The end result is <a href=\\\"https://github.com/filoxo/simple-style\\\">Simple Style</a> (which is still a WIP as requirements come up). Surprisingly, using <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/@dabit3/introduction-to-using-npm-as-a-build-tool-b41076f488b0#.5w4loc8uy\\\">npm as a build tool</a> made it extremely easy to set up a dev environment. I'll review everything about the setup in this post for my own documentation, but hopefully can also serve as a clean, straightforward example.</p>\\n<p>I used <a href=\\\"https://yarnpkg.com/en/\\\"><code>yarn</code></a> for this experiment instead of <code>npm</code> solely for the speed improvements. Fortunately, <code>yarn</code>'s commands all have their <code>npm</code> equivalents so don't get hung up on the differences.</p>\\n<p>This basic setup offers:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Autoprefixing to support the 2 latest browsers</li>\\n<li>Future CSS syntax usable today</li>\\n<li>minification</li>\\n<li>optimizations</li>\\n<li>a quick and easy development setup to reflect changes on-the-fly</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Dev dependencies</h3>\\n<p>Here are our initial development dependencies:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/\\\">normalize.css</a>: so that all elements render consistently</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/postcss/postcss\\\">PostCSS</a>'s CLI: to leverage its ecosystem of feature plugins</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://cssnext.io/\\\">CSSnext</a>: a PostCSS plugin that helps you to use the latest CSS syntax today. This way the code will be a little more future-proof. Additionally, CSSnext also includes <a href=\\\"https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer\\\">Autoprefixer</a> as a dependency.</li>\\n<li><code>postcss-import</code>: used to pull in a css file that wasn't being preprocessed</li>\\n<li><code>cssnano</code>: minify and optimize output</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Install using yarn (or the npm equivalent)</p>\\n<pre><code>yarn add -D normalize.css postcss-cli postcss-cssnext postcss-import cssnano\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>PostCSS config</h3>\\n<p>Create a json file that contains the config for PostCSS. The docs named it <strong>options.json</strong> but I choose <strong>postcss.json</strong> for better clarity. The comments below explain some keys.</p>\\n<pre><code>{\\n    // Enable plugins in order\\n    \\\"use\\\": [\\n        \\\"postcss-import\\\",\\n        \\\"postcss-cssnext\\\",\\n        \\\"cssnano\\\"\\n    ],\\n    \\\"input\\\": \\\"main.css\\\",\\n    \\\"output\\\": \\\"dist/main.css\\\",\\n    // use locally installed plugins (eg. in node_modules)\\n    \\\"local-plugins\\\": true,\\n    // Enable sourcemaps\\n    \\\"map\\\": true,\\n    // CSSnext and cssnano both use autoprefixer, but for different features/purposes\\n    // see https://github.com/MoOx/postcss-cssnext/issues/323\\n    \\\"postcss-cssnext\\\": {\\n        \\\"warnForDuplicates\\\": false\\n    }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>CSS time</h3>\\n<p>Go ahead and create <strong>main.css</strong> at the project root. The above config will output to <strong>dist/</strong>. Here's a quick sample to put into the file for now.</p>\\n<pre><code>@import('normalize.css');\\n\\n:root {\\n    --color-primary: blue;\\n    --color-secondary: red;\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Building</h3>\\n<p>Use the postcss-cli with the config file passed in as an arg and save it as an npm script.</p>\\n<pre><code>\\\"scripts\\\": {\\n    \\\"build\\\": \\\"node_modules/postcss-cli/bin/postcss -c postcss.json\\\"\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now you can simply run <code>yarn run build</code> and your css will be processed and output to <strong>dist</strong>. But we can still do better.</p>\\n<h3>Watch for changes</h3>\\n<p>Enabling watch will auto-transform the css file on changes. Add another npm script, which is exactly the same as <code>build</code> but with the watch flag.</p>\\n<pre><code>\\\"build:dev\\\": \\\"node_modules/postcss-cli/bin/postcss -c postcss.json -w\\\"\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Livereload</h3>\\n<p>You wouldn't develop a CSS framework without seeing it rendered on a page so let's create a test page for development. Create <strong>index.html</strong> at the project root and populate it with some HTML, and add a link to your <strong>main.css</strong> file.</p>\\n<pre><code>&#x3C;!doctype html>\\n&#x3C;html lang=\\\"en-US\\\">\\n    &#x3C;head>\\n        &#x3C;link rel=\\\"stylesheet\\\" href=\\\"/dist/main.css\\\">\\n    &#x3C;/head>\\n    &#x3C;body>\\n        &#x3C;main>Hello world&#x3C;/main>\\n    &#x3C;/body>\\n&#x3C;/html>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/lr-http-server\\\"><code>lr-http-server</code></a> will reload on changes, as well as a functioning http server.</p>\\n<pre><code>yarn add -D lr-http-server\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>And then register a new npm script for it</p>\\n<pre><code>\\\"reload\\\": \\\"lr-http-server -p 3000\\\"\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Composing scripts</h3>\\n<p>We want the two above scripts to run in parallel so that if either the css or the html file changes the livereload server will do its job. <a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all\\\"><code>npm-run-all</code></a> with the <code>-p</code> (parallel) flag does this exactly.</p>\\n<pre><code>yarn add -D npm-run-all\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Join the two tasks together into a single npm script</p>\\n<pre><code>\\\"start\\\": \\\"npm-run-all -p build:dev reload\\\"\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>And then run easily with</p>\\n<pre><code>yarn start\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Done!</h3>\\n<p>You're ready to keep going developing your styles inside <strong>main.css</strong>.

But I can \\\"listen in\\\" on their public conversations and chime in when I have something to offer.</p>\\n<p>I've grouped these people by the main topics they talk about.</p>\\n<h4>Javascript</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/Una\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Una Kraveats</a> - UI eng, podcaster, artist</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/marcysutton\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Marcy Sutton</a> - Sr A11Y engineer &#x26; guru</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/sarah_edo\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Sarah Drasner</a> - Sr developer, speaker/writer</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/_ericelliott\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Eric Elliott</a> - practical advice, smart writing</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/mpjme\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Mattias Johansson</a> - also check out his Youtube channel, 'Fun Fun Function'</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>React</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/dan_abramov\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Dan Abramov</a> - Redux author, wise OSS contributor</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/ryanflorence\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Ryan Florence</a> - main contributor to React Router</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/mjackson\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Michael Jackson</a> - main contributor to React Router</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/thejameskyle\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">James Kyle</a> - Huge OSS contributor</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/kentcdodds\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Kent Dodds</a> - all around savvy guy</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/ken_wheeler\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Ken Wheeler</a> - OSS contributor, \\\"drunk cool uncle\\\" type</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Angular 2</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/victorsavkin\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Victor Savkin</a> - main architect of Angular Router</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/gdi2290\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Patrick Stapleton</a> - contributor to Angular Universal, Angular Class</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>News</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/JavaScriptDaily\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">JS Daily</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/frontendfront\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Front-End Front</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Tools</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/ChromiumDev\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Chrome Developers</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/eggheadio\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Egghead.io</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>I'm sure I missed some people on this list. It can't be comprehensive. But hopefully its a start for you.</p>\\n<p>Consider also following any of the accounts for meetups in your local area. For example, here in Utah where I live, <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/utjs\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">UtahJS</a>, <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/reactjsutah\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">ReactJS Utah</a>, <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/IonicUtah\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Ionic Utah</a> are on my radar too.</p>\\n<h2>Blogs</h2>\\n<p>Blogs are great for laying out a lot of content/ideas so they take more time to consume. Time is of the essence and I generally won't read a blog post unless its very interesting to me.

The end result is <a href=\\\"https://github.com/filoxo/simple-style\\\">Simple Style</a> (which is still a WIP as requirements come up). Surprisingly, using <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/@dabit3/introduction-to-using-npm-as-a-build-tool-b41076f488b0#.5w4loc8uy\\\">npm as a build tool</a> made it extremely easy to set up a dev environment. I'll review everything about the setup in this post for my own documentation, but hopefully can also serve as a clean, straightforward example.</p>\\n<p>I used <a href=\\\"https://yarnpkg.com/en/\\\"><code>yarn</code></a> for this experiment instead of <code>npm</code> solely for the speed improvements. Fortunately, <code>yarn</code>'s commands all have their <code>npm</code> equivalents so don't get hung up on the differences.</p>\\n<p>This basic setup offers:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Autoprefixing to support the 2 latest browsers</li>\\n<li>Future CSS syntax usable today</li>\\n<li>minification</li>\\n<li>optimizations</li>\\n<li>a quick and easy development setup to reflect changes on-the-fly</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Dev dependencies</h3>\\n<p>Here are our initial development dependencies:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/\\\">normalize.css</a>: so that all elements render consistently</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/postcss/postcss\\\">PostCSS</a>'s CLI: to leverage its ecosystem of feature plugins</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://cssnext.io/\\\">CSSnext</a>: a PostCSS plugin that helps you to use the latest CSS syntax today. This way the code will be a little more future-proof. Additionally, CSSnext also includes <a href=\\\"https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer\\\">Autoprefixer</a> as a dependency.</li>\\n<li><code>postcss-import</code>: used to pull in a css file that wasn't being preprocessed</li>\\n<li><code>cssnano</code>: minify and optimize output</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Install using yarn (or the npm equivalent)</p>\\n<pre><code>yarn add -D normalize.css postcss-cli postcss-cssnext postcss-import cssnano\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>PostCSS config</h3>\\n<p>Create a json file that contains the config for PostCSS. The docs named it <strong>options.json</strong> but I choose <strong>postcss.json</strong> for better clarity. The comments below explain some keys.</p>\\n<pre><code>{\\n    // Enable plugins in order\\n    \\\"use\\\": [\\n        \\\"postcss-import\\\",\\n        \\\"postcss-cssnext\\\",\\n        \\\"cssnano\\\"\\n    ],\\n    \\\"input\\\": \\\"main.css\\\",\\n    \\\"output\\\": \\\"dist/main.css\\\",\\n    // use locally installed plugins (eg. in node_modules)\\n    \\\"local-plugins\\\": true,\\n    // Enable sourcemaps\\n    \\\"map\\\": true,\\n    // CSSnext and cssnano both use autoprefixer, but for different features/purposes\\n    // see https://github.com/MoOx/postcss-cssnext/issues/323\\n    \\\"postcss-cssnext\\\": {\\n        \\\"warnForDuplicates\\\": false\\n    }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>CSS time</h3>\\n<p>Go ahead and create <strong>main.css</strong> at the project root. The above config will output to <strong>dist/</strong>. Here's a quick sample to put into the file for now.</p>\\n<pre><code>@import('normalize.css');\\n\\n:root {\\n    --color-primary: blue;\\n    --color-secondary: red;\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Building</h3>\\n<p>Use the postcss-cli with the config file passed in as an arg and save it as an npm script.</p>\\n<pre><code>\\\"scripts\\\": {\\n    \\\"build\\\": \\\"node_modules/postcss-cli/bin/postcss -c postcss.json\\\"\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now you can simply run <code>yarn run build</code> and your css will be processed and output to <strong>dist</strong>. But we can still do better.</p>\\n<h3>Watch for changes</h3>\\n<p>Enabling watch will auto-transform the css file on changes. Add another npm script, which is exactly the same as <code>build</code> but with the watch flag.</p>\\n<pre><code>\\\"build:dev\\\": \\\"node_modules/postcss-cli/bin/postcss -c postcss.json -w\\\"\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Livereload</h3>\\n<p>You wouldn't develop a CSS framework without seeing it rendered on a page so let's create a test page for development. Create <strong>index.html</strong> at the project root and populate it with some HTML, and add a link to your <strong>main.css</strong> file.</p>\\n<pre><code>&#x3C;!doctype html>\\n&#x3C;html lang=\\\"en-US\\\">\\n    &#x3C;head>\\n        &#x3C;link rel=\\\"stylesheet\\\" href=\\\"/dist/main.css\\\">\\n    &#x3C;/head>\\n    &#x3C;body>\\n        &#x3C;main>Hello world&#x3C;/main>\\n    &#x3C;/body>\\n&#x3C;/html>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/lr-http-server\\\"><code>lr-http-server</code></a> will reload on changes, as well as a functioning http server.</p>\\n<pre><code>yarn add -D lr-http-server\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>And then register a new npm script for it</p>\\n<pre><code>\\\"reload\\\": \\\"lr-http-server -p 3000\\\"\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Composing scripts</h3>\\n<p>We want the two above scripts to run in parallel so that if either the css or the html file changes the livereload server will do its job. <a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all\\\"><code>npm-run-all</code></a> with the <code>-p</code> (parallel) flag does this exactly.</p>\\n<pre><code>yarn add -D npm-run-all\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Join the two tasks together into a single npm script</p>\\n<pre><code>\\\"start\\\": \\\"npm-run-all -p build:dev reload\\\"\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>And then run easily with</p>\\n<pre><code>yarn start\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Done!</h3>\\n<p>You're ready to keep going developing your styles inside <strong>main.css</strong>.

I know that I've been able to glean much just from joining and listening to the right sources. Here's a list of my favorite people/blogs/podcasts to listen to. Get ready for a huge link list!</p>\\n<h2>Twitter</h2>\\n<p>There are a ton of really smart people on Twitter, most of whom I don't get a chance to talk to on a regular basis (if ever, actually). But I can \\\"listen in\\\" on their public conversations and chime in when I have something to offer.</p>\\n<p>I've grouped these people by the main topics they talk about.</p>\\n<h4>Javascript</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/Una\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Una Kraveats</a> - UI eng, podcaster, artist</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/marcysutton\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Marcy Sutton</a> - Sr A11Y engineer &#x26; guru</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/sarah_edo\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Sarah Drasner</a> - Sr developer, speaker/writer</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/_ericelliott\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Eric Elliott</a> - practical advice, smart writing</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/mpjme\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Mattias Johansson</a> - also check out his Youtube channel, 'Fun Fun Function'</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>React</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/dan_abramov\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Dan Abramov</a> - Redux author, wise OSS contributor</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/ryanflorence\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Ryan Florence</a> - main contributor to React Router</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/mjackson\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Michael Jackson</a> - main contributor to React Router</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/thejameskyle\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">James Kyle</a> - Huge OSS contributor</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/kentcdodds\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Kent Dodds</a> - all around savvy guy</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/ken_wheeler\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Ken Wheeler</a> - OSS contributor, \\\"drunk cool uncle\\\" type</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Angular 2</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/victorsavkin\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Victor Savkin</a> - main architect of Angular Router</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/gdi2290\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Patrick Stapleton</a> - contributor to Angular Universal, Angular Class</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>News</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/JavaScriptDaily\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">JS Daily</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/frontendfront\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Front-End Front</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Tools</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/ChromiumDev\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Chrome Developers</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/eggheadio\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Egghead.io</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>I'm sure I missed some people on this list. It can't be comprehensive. But hopefully its a start for you.</p>\\n<p>Consider also following any of the accounts for meetups in your local area. For example, here in Utah where I live, <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/utjs\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">UtahJS</a>, <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/reactjsutah\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">ReactJS Utah</a>, <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/IonicUtah\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Ionic Utah</a> are on my radar too.</p>\\n<h2>Blogs</h2>\\n<p>Blogs are great for laying out a lot of content/ideas so they take more time to consume. Time is of the essence and I generally won't read a blog post unless its very interesting to me. Here are the ones I watch.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/coolgithubprojects\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">r/coolgithubprojects</a>)</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">r/SideProject</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">r/webdev</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Angular2/\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">r/angular2</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">r/reactjs</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://frontendfront.com/\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Front end Front</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://css-tricks.com/\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">CSS Tricks</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Smashing Magazine</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://medium.com/on-Coding\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">On Coding - Medium</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>News</h4>\\n<p>News outlets aren't blogs really, but its great to stay in the loop about technology in general. Oh Twitter is looking to sell? Microsoft has the most open-source contributors on Gihutb? What's Google's latest hardware project? It's a good idea to be generally informed on technology.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://jaxenter.com/\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">JAXenter</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Naked Security</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://phys.org/technology-news/\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Phys.org - Technology News</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://arstechnica.com/\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">ArsTechnica</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.engadget.com/\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Engadget</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://gizmodo.com/\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Gizmodo</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://mashable.com/\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Mashable</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">TechCrunch</a></li>\\n</ul>\",\"id\":\"/Users/cfiloteo/dev/blog/src/pages/2016-09-22-recommended-resources/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"timeToRead\":3,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"2016-09-22T00:00:00.000Z\",\"path\":\"/posts/recommended-resources\",\"tags\":[\"javascript\"],\"title\":\"Recommended Resources\"}}}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/posts-crossplatform-revisited.json\n// module id = ./node_modules/json-loader/index.js!./.cache/json/posts-crossplatform-revisited.json\n// module chunks = 225461088127042"],"sourceRoot":""}
