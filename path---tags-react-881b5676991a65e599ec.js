The biggest hurdle would be knowing the software well enough to enable the hardware. I was lucky in that the <a href="https://atreus.technomancy.us/assembly-hand-wired.pdf">Atreus hand wire guide</a> is pretty comprehensive, as well as relying on great resources like this <a href="https://imgur.com/a/qcgdF">"Modern handwiring guide"</a>. I already knew a fair amount about pro micros from previous builds (I\'ve built 4 other keyboards but with PCBs) so that gave me lots of information about its limitations, and where stuff goes; as well as with experience with <a href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware">QMK</a>. There are plenty of awesome and active people on the QMK Gitter if you get stuck with the firmware. I also had plenty of help from the great people in the <a href="https://discord.gg/tjjT8J">UTMK discord</a> (which welcomes anyone really) regarding the hardware aspect of my build. </p>\n<h3>Build in review</h3>\n<p>\n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="1"\n        title=""\n        src="/static/b2b4b59c5be9274ef2da82cde8ae4f5f-55338.jpg"\n        srcset="/static/b2b4b59c5be9274ef2da82cde8ae4f5f-a21e6.jpg 163w,\n/static/b2b4b59c5be9274ef2da82cde8ae4f5f-4ac53.jpg 325w,\n/static/b2b4b59c5be9274ef2da82cde8ae4f5f-55338.jpg 650w,\n/static/b2b4b59c5be9274ef2da82cde8ae4f5f-80f1d.jpg 975w,\n/static/b2b4b59c5be9274ef2da82cde8ae4f5f-7fc90.jpg 1300w,\n/static/b2b4b59c5be9274ef2da82cde8ae4f5f-96c4f.jpg 1950w,\n/static/b2b4b59c5be9274ef2da82cde8ae4f5f-3b893.jpg 2784w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  </p>\n<p>The case is laser cut from ¼" plywood.

I've used Angular 2+ heavily for the last year at work, have recently rewritten an Angular 1 app in React, and have chosen to use Vue for my personal projects for now. These are some of my thoughts on what I found to be some good and bad parts of Angular.</p>\n<h3>The Good</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>As a full framework, you'll experience less decision fatigue and won't have lib fragmentation (eg. team A uses Axios, team B uses Superagent).</li>\n<li>‎TypeScript makes JavaScript feel familiar to backend/full-stack devs.</li>\n<li>RxJS/‎Observables are so awesome! This reactive data flow also helps you keep your components UI-focused.</li>\n<li>‎The Angular CLI is fantastic! Its so good, in fact, that it hardly makes sense to use anything else.</li>\n<li>‎Predictable and periodic framework updates set a great rhythm. Of course, this is personal preference. I've read some other peoples' struggles with having gotten too far behind... but the cadence with which Angular releases feels just right.</li>\n<li>The animations API is good when it works. React's TransitionGroup is the equivalent, but most React beginners don't know about it or how to find it to solve animations with components mounting/unmounting. The Angular animations work well for this same usage, but there have been quite a few bugs with it between versions. I had to revert to CSS animations. Hopefully they've been fixed and that has stablized.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Bad</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>With TypeScript it is easy to bloat your code &#x26; forget to push business logic down to the server.</li>\n<li>‎Modules+routes are the only option for creating code split boundaries. So far, there hasn't been a community-built solution for code splitting elsewhere.</li>\n<li>Using Services to manage state is hard. It almost doesn't make sense to have Services and I'm about 90% sure this syntax was carried over for those who have a hard time migrating from Angular 1. Because of this there is little to no standardization on how services should work or be used. We ended up using Services to only hold Observables...</li>\n<li>‎Good luck trying to get any native js modules to work. Maybe that lib doesn't have types. Or requires a browser global. Or can't be statically analyzed by the TS compiler... The list goes on.</li>\n<li>Testing is just BAD. Testing requires 30+ lines of boilerplate, and requires a lot of ceremony. I have not written a test that actually works with Angular that hasn't felt extremely frail. From configuring the TestBed to updating selectors, testing is a huge burden compared to how easy it is with React and Vue.</li>\n<li>Angular errors are convoluted and imprecise. Welcome to debugging hell. 👿</li>\n<li>Having a wrapping host element is bad for styling. This is mainly because we have a legacy style framework. One such problem was with a widget that uses immediate child selectors, and the host element prevents this from working correctly. If you could get total buy-in to encapsulated styles, you shouldn't face this issue.</li>\n<li>RxJS takes effort and time to master, and the docs could use a lot of work. We've had to learn about Observables,BehaviorSujects, Subscriptions, and a plethora of operators with difficult names (switchMap, flatMap, zip, idk how many more).</li>\n<li>‎There's no equivalent of React's stateless functional component and that is sad. Sometimes it would be much easier if a component didn't need state and accept only Inputs (props for you React users).</li>\n<li>The <code>&#x3C;router-outlet></code> prevents you from being able flow data down to Components. This is a HUGE issue and I hate it with a passion.</li>\n<li>Development Tooling with Angular is severely lacking. Augury was an attempt at dev tools for Angular but is a total failure. Unable to view your Angular component tree or intereact with your data stores makes for a poor DX.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I've written approximately twice as many \"bads\" as \"goods\" for this article, but that doesn't mean I hate Angular. It is definitely a viable option, and still has the backing of Google despite some misteps with branding and architecture. I just hope these issues are something you might analyze before using, or can use your voice and vote to help improve Angular.</p>",

Now, I\'m no expert but I do have experience with both Angular and React. This post lists some of the differences between the actual usage of Angular (2+) and React. I hope to just shed some light on the practical differences between them to help you understand the decision a bit better.</p>\n<h3>Complexity</h3>\n<p>Frameworks are abstractions to help reduce the complexity of building an application. Frameworks in turn introduce their own complexity. First, let\'s establish that each framework falls somewhere on a complexity spectrum.<a href="#vuejsTalk">¹</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is the first problem: <strong>React and Angular are at different points of the complexity spectrum</strong>. They\'re solving problems in different ways, and will never be equal to each other in scope. Using another analogy, they\'re different tools for different and various jobs; some of those jobs overlap, others don\'t.</p>\n<p>For the most part, choosing between them based on this alone is <strong>moot</strong>. Why? Because React is "unopinionated" so you bring your own solution to solve problem X. Inversely, Angular provides many tools together into one framework. It is not an apples-to-apples comparison.</p>\n<h4>Complexity: React</h4>\n<p>Let\'s start with React here. React is not a complete framework, you are required to bring in dependencies on your own. This is can be great but also daunting. Not all developers who work on the web know about the very latest libs, are proficient with <code>npm</code> or <code>yarn</code>, or can set up an ES6 project to transpile down to ES5.</p>\n<p>In an enterprise setting, choosing a library might need more consideration than "just because". Does the lib\'s license allow enterprise use? What if an engineering manager needs to know the difference between various libs? Which library contains enough features to support future projects/requirements?</p>\n<p>A personal experience of this I had is choosing an HTTP library. There are so many great choices! Some of the ones I\'ve looked at to use with React are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios">Axios</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent">Superagent</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird">Bluebird</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/github/fetch">Fetch</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/developit/unfetch">Unfetch</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The company I work for is slowly coming around to adopting React but what\'s there to stop each team from choosing a different lib from of the above? Allowing this sort of fragmentation makes it that much harder to share code and contribute to other teams. Furthermore, making a decision to standardize one requires intimate knowledge of the features, benefits, and disadvantages of each.</p>\n<p>Now, <em>this evaluation process isn\'t bad</em>! It would GREAT to make a thorough and informed decision but not every developer or team is equipped to make this kind of analysis for every dependency. If this isn\'t something that you or your team can or want to do, then consider a full framework like Angular. Conversely, if developers are passionate about jumping in and learning each lib quickly then this isn\'t a problem.</p>\n<h4>Complexity: Angular</h4>\n<p>With Angular you\'re getting many of libraries together from a single source, compatible and tested. Angular is an abstraction built on top of a component model, TypeScript, RxJS, Webpack, to name a few. The advantages I see here are:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Documentation exists showing how to use each lib within context of the framework</li>\n    <li>Each standard lib will be compatible and integrates better than external libs might</li>\n    <li>a solution is already "chosen" for you by the time you encounter a problem to be solved</li>\n    <li>Angular\'s implementation of semver means that most updates will follow a compatible rhythm</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are some disadvantages:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>You\'re getting a whole lot of framework to have to learn together, the learning curve here can be steep and overwhelming</li>\n    <li>Angular\'s documentation is not the very best</li>\n    <li>there\'s no sensibility in trying to replace one part of the framework for another lib</li>\n    <li>Full-frameworks can add in a lot of code that you don\'t use<sup>*</sup></li>\n    <li>Re-using the Angular namespace means that there\'s a lot of conflation between AngularJS (version 1) and Angular (2+)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><sup>*</sup>Both frameworks, if configured properly, discards unused dependencies from a production build (a process known as tree-shaking).</p>\n<h3>Framework</h3>\n<p>React\'s model of a single component drives to you really want to keep your components tiny, and import the rest. On average, my React components stay at less than 50 lines. Keeping components tiny really helps with composability.\nAngular uses a similar component model, but requires at least 10+ lines just to declare, along 2 accompanying files—a template file and a style file. Keeping the template separate has had an unforeseen consequence: templates get <em>huge</em> and end up more bloated than needed. Because of this, I feel like there\'s a desire to add more logic to the class than a single component actually needs. Its all to easy to bloat a single component instead of breaking it out into smaller pieces.</p>\n<h3>Tools</h3>\n<p>React has <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app">create-react-app</a>, a very small commandline tool to generate a React project. It\'s purposefully pretty bare bones and new features are only added with much consideration and discussion. In my subjective experience, I\'ve found that a sizable number of people chose to eject so that they have more control over their build config. This usually happens when they seek to include a feature/build step that CRA can\'t/won\'t include.</p>\n<p>Angular has the <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli">angular-cli</a>, a very functional commandline tool that pulls together a great number of useful features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Generator (like Yeoman)</li>\n<li>Dev server with live reload (using webpack-dev-server)</li>\n<li>Preconfigured css preprocessing (Sass, Less, or Stylus)</li>\n<li>Preconfigured linting (tslint)</li>\n<li>Preconfigured testing (Karma)</li>\n<li>Build configuration for dev &#x26; production</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Angular CLI has become much more robust and helps many devs quickly achieve things that might take much more manual configuration and experience. I\'ve very much enjoyed using the Angular CLI. The biggest issue I\'ve had with it are bad configurations: retroactive upgrades, version mismatches, or borked upgrades.</p>\n<h4>Ecosystem: React</h4>\n<p>React, backed by Facebook, has been favored by many developers and companies, like Microsoft and Samsung. React is the <strong>#1</strong> most-loved and 3rd most wanted framework<a href="#StackOverflowDeveloperSurvey2017">²</a> according to StackOverflow\'s 2017 Developer Survey. There are tons of React-based projects (this blog uses <a href="https://phenomic.io/">Phenomic</a>! 🤘 ) as well as React components. React\'s single-responsibility model has led to development of other great community-driven libraries that can enhance your app\'s functionality. Projects like <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">React Router</a>, <a href="http://redux.js.org/">Redux</a>/<a href="https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx">MobX</a>, and React Native have all sprouted and thrived under <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/869732167814848512">the big React tent</a>.</p>\n<p>Even more interesting, <a href="https://preactjs.com/">Preact</a> and <a href="https://infernojs.org/">Inferno</a> are <em>"almost drop-in"</em> alternatives that have same/similar API; I find that many developers using React have literally never heard of either 🤔 yet these can offer even better performance for many apps.</p>\n<p>React\'s ecosystem is as prolyfic as one could hope for.</p>\n<h4>Ecosystem: Angular</h4>\n<p>Angular on the other hand feels very much like "corporate" or enterprise softare. The API very much feels like <em>This is how we solved this problem, and you get to use it that way</em>. Regardless, adoption of Angular 2 has not lagged behind at all.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1.3 million people use Angular 1.<br>480k already use Angular 2.</p>&mdash; David East (@_davideast) <a href="https://twitter.com/_davideast/status/776244105261133824">September 15, 2016</a></blockquote>\n<script defer src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>\n<p>And this quote is somewhat old; these numbers have most likely increased. Angular ranks very high as a popular framework: 6th most loved, 4th most dreaded, and 2nd most wanted<a href="#StackOverflowDeveloperSurvey2017">²</a> <a href="#footnote2">³</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>The Angular ecosystem is not quite as expansive, but has Google\'s weight behind the rest of their products to push out additional libraries that align with Angular. What that means is companion projects like <a href="https://github.com/angular/material2">Angular Material</a>, <a href="https://github.com/angular/angularfire2">AngularFire2</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/angular/universal">Angular Universal</a> are kept up to date with the Angular core. Aside from these projects there aren\'t as many thriving projects built for Angular as I\'d like to see. Many of these have gotten out of date very fast.</p>\n<p>TypeScript has seen some great progress and adoption in the JS community as a whole; its the 3rd most loved and 6th most wanted language of 2017<a href="#StackOverflowDeveloperSurvey2017">²</a>! Furthermore, a success with TypeScript that I\'ve experienced is that it makes backend developers a more comfortable writing JavaScript. It enables bringing in some concepts that can help make a webapp more robust, in addition to being an ES6 transpiler. Learning TypeScript\'s features and syntax was not difficult.</p>\n<p>The most difficult part of using TypeScript is finding the correct type definitions (typings) to go along with your dependent libs. Most are available via npm under the <code>@types</code> namespace but if that isn\'t the case, you lose the main benefit of TypeScript in the first place: type safety. At the same time, that\'s no reason not to use Angular! It would make the developer all that better by taking the initiative to contribute the types. Yay for open source software! But this is a challege that you may face with Angular.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>This long-winded explanation is really just to say: Don\'t choose between React and Angular just because you\'re a fan of one. <strong>Choose the one that fits your project\'s requirements; the one whose risks and challenges you\'re willing to accept; the one that is the sane investment considering the needs of the developer, team, and business.</strong> Ultimately, both frameworks are backed by major companies. Both have great developers that lead them, and communities surrounding them. Both solve complex problems and can be used to build great web apps.</p>\n<p>If you can, don\'t lock yourself into one. Always keep learning about what else can solve the problem at hand. ✌️</p>\n<hr>\n<small>\nFootnotes:\n<ul>\n<li><a name="vuejsTalk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBBSp_iIiVM" target="_blank">1: "Vue.js: the Progressive Framework"</a></li>\n<li><a name="StackOverflowDeveloperSurvey2017" href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017" target="_blank">2: StackOverflow Developer Survey 2017</a></li>\n<li><a name="footnote2">3: </a> I don\'t think the survey properly distinguishes between AngularJS (version 1) and Angular (2+).

NgContent isn\'t well documented.</p>\n<h3>Why isn\'t <code>ng-content</code> self-closing?</h3>\n<p><code>ng-content</code> is to be used like any other element. This is great, especially for rendering in default content. For example, a component that can transclude some content but if for some reason nothing is nested into it, it will show a default state.</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;profile-card>\n    &#x3C;ng-content>\n        &#x3C;img src="/defaultProfile.jpg"/>\n        &#x3C;p>Unknown&#x3C;/p>\n    &#x3C;/ng-content>\n&#x3C;/profile-card>\n</code></pre>\n<p>But what if you don\'t need anything within the opening and closing tags? You\'d think that just <code>&#x3C;ng-content /></code> would be a nice and simple way to signal where to place the included content, but attempting to do so generates the following error:</p>\n<pre><code>Template parse errors: Only void and foreign elements can be self closed "ng-content"\n[ERROR ->]&#x3C;ng-content />\n</code></pre>\n<p>Seems weird to me. This may be by design.</p>\n<h3>Select is only able to find immediate children?</h3>\n<p>One of the features of <code>ng-content</code> is that you can use the <code>select</code> attribute on it to pull transcluded content into a specific location.</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;!-- my-component.html -->\n&#x3C;div>\n    &#x3C;ng-content select=".title">&#x3C;/ng-content>\n    &#x3C;ng-content select=".subtitle">&#x3C;/ng-content>\n&#x3C;/div>\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is great for enforcing layout in a specific way. Except... it has a <strong>major</strong> caveat, at least in my opinion. This select only seems to match <em>immediate children only</em>, nothing else.</p>\n<p>So using the above <code>my-component</code>, this belwo works while placing the <code>title</code> above the <code>subtitle</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;my-component>\n    &#x3C;p class="subtitle">world&#x3C;/p>\n    &#x3C;h2 class="title">Hello&#x3C;/h2>\n&#x3C;/my-component>\n</code></pre>\n<p>but then this doesn\'t! Nothing is rendered.</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;my-component>\n    &#x3C;div>\n        &#x3C;h2 class="title">Hello&#x3C;/h2>\n        &#x3C;p class="subtitle">world&#x3C;/p>\n    &#x3C;/div>\n&#x3C;/my-component>\n</code></pre>\n<p>It can\'t find these same elements  because they\'re wrapped in an extra div? I would have thought that it would match those elements as well, just like <code>querySelector</code> or CSS selectors would. If I only wanted immediate children I would have used something like <code>select="> .title"</code>. My assumption that it used standard selectors is wrong? ¯\\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯ That sucks.</p>',id:"/Users/cfiloteo/dev/blog/src/pages/2017-04-05-thoughts-on-angular-ng-content/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:2,frontmatter:{date:"2017-04-05T00:00:00.000Z",path:"/posts/thoughts-on-angular-ngcontent",tags:["angular"],title:"Thoughts on Angular: Ng-Content"}}],employment:[{excerpt:"I want to make it clear that these opinions are my own and reflect only my experience.

My employer is an amazing place to work if you can get your foot in the door. This complaint is with the <strong>hiring process</strong> only. There are some major issues with the hiring process that have made me extremely frustrated, to the point where I want to gripe about it.</p>\n<h3>Into the void</h3>\n<p>I\'ve had many people reach out to me about applying, and as a developer there isn\'t much more that I can do apart from give some general advice to prep for an interview and generating a referral.</p>\n<p>The problem that has me furious is that after one of these individual applies, there\'s little to no follow up from company. Only 13% of my referrals ever even received a response. The rest have sat in our recruiting system(s) as "inactive" or "pending recruiter response". What bothers me about this is that this is polite and timely responses can be automated! Fire off an \'Application Received\' email; send a \'Thank you for applying\' once the position is closed; Deliver a \'Sorry about the lack of response\' message if an application has sat for X weeks without any recruiter activity.</p>\n<p>Because this is so easy with modern systems and common-place at other companies, I find it <strong>extremely rude and inconsiderate</strong> to prospective employees for this company. I\'ve now begun letting people know that they may not hear back at all, ever. 👎</p>\n<h3>Got Privilege? ✅</h3>\n<p>Another seemingly arbitrary requirement is that applicants must have a college degree. Seriously. I recently heard some spew about "attempting to attract only the best" but this ignores the fact that this is a <em>very bad</em> policy for diversity &#x26; inclusion. The number of minorities (specifically hispanic and black) who graduate from college is far lower than white/Europeans.\nI\'m not trying to fight for affirmative action here, but this can lead to a form of candidate suppression: many qualified people are immediately excluded from the pool. There are so many individuals who are very smart and higher education wasn\'t in the cards for them. Real world experience and a proven track record is equally valuable in my experience.</p>\n<p>Anectodally, I heard that an offer was <strong>reneged</strong> because the applicant didn\'t have a degree, regardless of their previous experience. WTF 😞</p>\n<h3>Woe, woe, woe</h3>\n<p>I <em>think</em> the main reason for this is because we have too few recruiters for the number of applicants. Our HR team is ~10 people in a company of 1500+ employees—that\'s less than 1%. As a developer, I don\'t know how many applications are received per opening but the two that I\'ve been a part of have received 200+. That\'s a lot of work for such a small team! The above mentioned practices really aren\'t helping anything either. Its a people problem and a process problem.</p>\n<p>Even more frustrating with the issue here is that there\'s nothing I can really do. Sure, I could talk to someone higher up. I\'ve complained somewhat openly to my coworkers. But honestly, there\'s probably no real change that I can make. At least, not as a developer.</p>\n<h3>On the bright side...</h3>\n<p>Like I said at the beginning of this post, this company is <strong>great</strong> to work for if there was any possibility of being able to get an interview. I\'m optimistic that the problems above are fairly easy to fix with just a few changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setup automated communications</li>\n<li>Find flaws in the application pipeline and solve</li>\n<li>Hire more/better personnel</li>\n<li>Remove the hard requirement of university degrees</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I retain the hope that someday this company can better their hiring processes and become a place to which I would recommend any of my developer friends.</p>',id:"/Users/cfiloteo/dev/blog/src/pages/2017-06-07-why-I-wont-recommend-my-employer/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:3,frontmatter:{date:"2017-06-07T00:00:00.000Z",path:"/posts/why-im-not-currently-recommending-my-employer",tags:["employment"],title:"Why I won't recommend my employer"}}],react:[{excerpt:'I sometimes see developers ask "Should I use React, or Angular, or Vue.js, or  [ insert new framework here ] ?" and every time, I see fanatics immediately jump to recommending one without any real justification.

Now, I\'m no expert but I do have experience with both Angular and React. This post lists some of the differences between the actual usage of Angular (2+) and React. I hope to just shed some light on the practical differences between them to help you understand the decision a bit better.</p>\n<h3>Complexity</h3>\n<p>Frameworks are abstractions to help reduce the complexity of building an application. Frameworks in turn introduce their own complexity. First, let\'s establish that each framework falls somewhere on a complexity spectrum.<a href="#vuejsTalk">¹</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is the first problem: <strong>React and Angular are at different points of the complexity spectrum</strong>. They\'re solving problems in different ways, and will never be equal to each other in scope. Using another analogy, they\'re different tools for different and various jobs; some of those jobs overlap, others don\'t.</p>\n<p>For the most part, choosing between them based on this alone is <strong>moot</strong>. Why? Because React is "unopinionated" so you bring your own solution to solve problem X. Inversely, Angular provides many tools together into one framework. It is not an apples-to-apples comparison.</p>\n<h4>Complexity: React</h4>\n<p>Let\'s start with React here. React is not a complete framework, you are required to bring in dependencies on your own. This is can be great but also daunting. Not all developers who work on the web know about the very latest libs, are proficient with <code>npm</code> or <code>yarn</code>, or can set up an ES6 project to transpile down to ES5.</p>\n<p>In an enterprise setting, choosing a library might need more consideration than "just because". Does the lib\'s license allow enterprise use? What if an engineering manager needs to know the difference between various libs? Which library contains enough features to support future projects/requirements?</p>\n<p>A personal experience of this I had is choosing an HTTP library. There are so many great choices! Some of the ones I\'ve looked at to use with React are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios">Axios</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent">Superagent</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird">Bluebird</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/github/fetch">Fetch</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/developit/unfetch">Unfetch</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The company I work for is slowly coming around to adopting React but what\'s there to stop each team from choosing a different lib from of the above? Allowing this sort of fragmentation makes it that much harder to share code and contribute to other teams. Furthermore, making a decision to standardize one requires intimate knowledge of the features, benefits, and disadvantages of each.</p>\n<p>Now, <em>this evaluation process isn\'t bad</em>! It would GREAT to make a thorough and informed decision but not every developer or team is equipped to make this kind of analysis for every dependency. If this isn\'t something that you or your team can or want to do, then consider a full framework like Angular. Conversely, if developers are passionate about jumping in and learning each lib quickly then this isn\'t a problem.</p>\n<h4>Complexity: Angular</h4>\n<p>With Angular you\'re getting many of libraries together from a single source, compatible and tested. Angular is an abstraction built on top of a component model, TypeScript, RxJS, Webpack, to name a few. The advantages I see here are:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Documentation exists showing how to use each lib within context of the framework</li>\n    <li>Each standard lib will be compatible and integrates better than external libs might</li>\n    <li>a solution is already "chosen" for you by the time you encounter a problem to be solved</li>\n    <li>Angular\'s implementation of semver means that most updates will follow a compatible rhythm</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are some disadvantages:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>You\'re getting a whole lot of framework to have to learn together, the learning curve here can be steep and overwhelming</li>\n    <li>Angular\'s documentation is not the very best</li>\n    <li>there\'s no sensibility in trying to replace one part of the framework for another lib</li>\n    <li>Full-frameworks can add in a lot of code that you don\'t use<sup>*</sup></li>\n    <li>Re-using the Angular namespace means that there\'s a lot of conflation between AngularJS (version 1) and Angular (2+)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><sup>*</sup>Both frameworks, if configured properly, discards unused dependencies from a production build (a process known as tree-shaking).</p>\n<h3>Framework</h3>\n<p>React\'s model of a single component drives to you really want to keep your components tiny, and import the rest. On average, my React components stay at less than 50 lines. Keeping components tiny really helps with composability.\nAngular uses a similar component model, but requires at least 10+ lines just to declare, along 2 accompanying files—a template file and a style file. Keeping the template separate has had an unforeseen consequence: templates get <em>huge</em> and end up more bloated than needed. Because of this, I feel like there\'s a desire to add more logic to the class than a single component actually needs. Its all to easy to bloat a single component instead of breaking it out into smaller pieces.</p>\n<h3>Tools</h3>\n<p>React has <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app">create-react-app</a>, a very small commandline tool to generate a React project. It\'s purposefully pretty bare bones and new features are only added with much consideration and discussion. In my subjective experience, I\'ve found that a sizable number of people chose to eject so that they have more control over their build config. This usually happens when they seek to include a feature/build step that CRA can\'t/won\'t include.</p>\n<p>Angular has the <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli">angular-cli</a>, a very functional commandline tool that pulls together a great number of useful features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Generator (like Yeoman)</li>\n<li>Dev server with live reload (using webpack-dev-server)</li>\n<li>Preconfigured css preprocessing (Sass, Less, or Stylus)</li>\n<li>Preconfigured linting (tslint)</li>\n<li>Preconfigured testing (Karma)</li>\n<li>Build configuration for dev &#x26; production</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Angular CLI has become much more robust and helps many devs quickly achieve things that might take much more manual configuration and experience. I\'ve very much enjoyed using the Angular CLI. The biggest issue I\'ve had with it are bad configurations: retroactive upgrades, version mismatches, or borked upgrades.</p>\n<h4>Ecosystem: React</h4>\n<p>React, backed by Facebook, has been favored by many developers and companies, like Microsoft and Samsung. React is the <strong>#1</strong> most-loved and 3rd most wanted framework<a href="#StackOverflowDeveloperSurvey2017">²</a> according to StackOverflow\'s 2017 Developer Survey. There are tons of React-based projects (this blog uses <a href="https://phenomic.io/">Phenomic</a>! 🤘 ) as well as React components. React\'s single-responsibility model has led to development of other great community-driven libraries that can enhance your app\'s functionality. Projects like <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">React Router</a>, <a href="http://redux.js.org/">Redux</a>/<a href="https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx">MobX</a>, and React Native have all sprouted and thrived under <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/869732167814848512">the big React tent</a>.</p>\n<p>Even more interesting, <a href="https://preactjs.com/">Preact</a> and <a href="https://infernojs.org/">Inferno</a> are <em>"almost drop-in"</em> alternatives that have same/similar API; I find that many developers using React have literally never heard of either 🤔 yet these can offer even better performance for many apps.</p>\n<p>React\'s ecosystem is as prolyfic as one could hope for.</p>\n<h4>Ecosystem: Angular</h4>\n<p>Angular on the other hand feels very much like "corporate" or enterprise softare. The API very much feels like <em>This is how we solved this problem, and you get to use it that way</em>. Regardless, adoption of Angular 2 has not lagged behind at all.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1.3 million people use Angular 1.<br>480k already use Angular 2.</p>&mdash; David East (@_davideast) <a href="https://twitter.com/_davideast/status/776244105261133824">September 15, 2016</a></blockquote>\n<script defer src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>\n<p>And this quote is somewhat old; these numbers have most likely increased. Angular ranks very high as a popular framework: 6th most loved, 4th most dreaded, and 2nd most wanted<a href="#StackOverflowDeveloperSurvey2017">²</a> <a href="#footnote2">³</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>The Angular ecosystem is not quite as expansive, but has Google\'s weight behind the rest of their products to push out additional libraries that align with Angular. What that means is companion projects like <a href="https://github.com/angular/material2">Angular Material</a>, <a href="https://github.com/angular/angularfire2">AngularFire2</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/angular/universal">Angular Universal</a> are kept up to date with the Angular core. Aside from these projects there aren\'t as many thriving projects built for Angular as I\'d like to see. Many of these have gotten out of date very fast.</p>\n<p>TypeScript has seen some great progress and adoption in the JS community as a whole; its the 3rd most loved and 6th most wanted language of 2017<a href="#StackOverflowDeveloperSurvey2017">²</a>! Furthermore, a success with TypeScript that I\'ve experienced is that it makes backend developers a more comfortable writing JavaScript. It enables bringing in some concepts that can help make a webapp more robust, in addition to being an ES6 transpiler. Learning TypeScript\'s features and syntax was not difficult.</p>\n<p>The most difficult part of using TypeScript is finding the correct type definitions (typings) to go along with your dependent libs. Most are available via npm under the <code>@types</code> namespace but if that isn\'t the case, you lose the main benefit of TypeScript in the first place: type safety. At the same time, that\'s no reason not to use Angular! It would make the developer all that better by taking the initiative to contribute the types. Yay for open source software! But this is a challege that you may face with Angular.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>This long-winded explanation is really just to say: Don\'t choose between React and Angular just because you\'re a fan of one. <strong>Choose the one that fits your project\'s requirements; the one whose risks and challenges you\'re willing to accept; the one that is the sane investment considering the needs of the developer, team, and business.</strong> Ultimately, both frameworks are backed by major companies. Both have great developers that lead them, and communities surrounding them. Both solve complex problems and can be used to build great web apps.</p>\n<p>If you can, don\'t lock yourself into one. Always keep learning about what else can solve the problem at hand. ✌️</p>\n<hr>\n<small>\nFootnotes:\n<ul>\n<li><a name="vuejsTalk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBBSp_iIiVM" target="_blank">1: "Vue.js: the Progressive Framework"</a></li>\n<li><a name="StackOverflowDeveloperSurvey2017" href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017" target="_blank">2: StackOverflow Developer Survey 2017</a></li>\n<li><a name="footnote2">3: </a> I don\'t think the survey properly distinguishes between AngularJS (version 1) and Angular (2+).

The docs named it <strong>options.json</strong> but I choose <strong>postcss.json</strong> for better clarity. The comments below explain some keys.</p>\n<pre><code>{\n    // Enable plugins in order\n    "use": [\n        "postcss-import",\n        "postcss-cssnext",\n        "cssnano"\n    ],\n    "input": "main.css",\n    "output": "dist/main.css",\n    // use locally installed plugins (eg. in node_modules)\n    "local-plugins": true,\n    // Enable sourcemaps\n    "map": true,\n    // CSSnext and cssnano both use autoprefixer, but for different features/purposes\n    // see https://github.com/MoOx/postcss-cssnext/issues/323\n    "postcss-cssnext": {\n        "warnForDuplicates": false\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>CSS time</h3>\n<p>Go ahead and create <strong>main.css</strong> at the project root. The above config will output to <strong>dist/</strong>. Here\'s a quick sample to put into the file for now.</p>\n<pre><code>@import(\'normalize.css\');\n\n:root {\n    --color-primary: blue;\n    --color-secondary: red;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Building</h3>\n<p>Use the postcss-cli with the config file passed in as an arg and save it as an npm script.</p>\n<pre><code>"scripts": {\n    "build": "node_modules/postcss-cli/bin/postcss -c postcss.json"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now you can simply run <code>yarn run build</code> and your css will be processed and output to <strong>dist</strong>. But we can still do better.</p>\n<h3>Watch for changes</h3>\n<p>Enabling watch will auto-transform the css file on changes. Add another npm script, which is exactly the same as <code>build</code> but with the watch flag.</p>\n<pre><code>"build:dev": "node_modules/postcss-cli/bin/postcss -c postcss.json -w"\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Livereload</h3>\n<p>You wouldn\'t develop a CSS framework without seeing it rendered on a page so let\'s create a test page for development. Create <strong>index.html</strong> at the project root and populate it with some HTML, and add a link to your <strong>main.css</strong> file.</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;!doctype html>\n&#x3C;html lang="en-US">\n    &#x3C;head>\n        &#x3C;link rel="stylesheet" href="/dist/main.css">\n    &#x3C;/head>\n    &#x3C;body>\n        &#x3C;main>Hello world&#x3C;/main>\n    &#x3C;/body>\n&#x3C;/html>\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/lr-http-server"><code>lr-http-server</code></a> will reload on changes, as well as a functioning http server.</p>\n<pre><code>yarn add -D lr-http-server\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then register a new npm script for it</p>\n<pre><code>"reload": "lr-http-server -p 3000"\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Composing scripts</h3>\n<p>We want the two above scripts to run in parallel so that if either the css or the html file changes the livereload server will do its job. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all"><code>npm-run-all</code></a> with the <code>-p</code> (parallel) flag does this exactly.</p>\n<pre><code>yarn add -D npm-run-all\n</code></pre>\n<p>Join the two tasks together into a single npm script</p>\n<pre><code>"start": "npm-run-all -p build:dev reload"\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then run easily with</p>\n<pre><code>yarn start\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Done!</h3>\n<p>You\'re ready to keep going developing your styles inside <strong>main.css</strong>.

In this post I'll revisit my choice of tooling.</p>\n<h3>Password manager</h3>\n<p>Having put a password manager in place to store, generate, and access my passphrases has been one of the most beneficial tools I've been able to use in my day-to-day. KeePass has long been the standard for accomplishing this but the clients built around it have not kept up—at least not very well.</p>\n<h4>KeeWeb</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://keeweb.info/\">KeeWeb</a> is built with Electron and gives the KeePass standard a decent interface on Windows, MacOS, Linux, and even as a <a href=\"https://app.keeweb.info/\">web app</a>. It can sync with Google Drive, generate new passwords, and uses the same keyboard shortcuts as KeePassX and then some.</p>\n<p>The only problem with this app is maybe a bug: it's browser autofill feature seems to populate the browser URL bar with the site and password, rather than navigating to the site before pasting in the credentials. This means that my browser history could potentially have a password in plain text. Because this is such a huge no-no I never use this feature anymore.</p>\n<h4>LastPass</h4>\n<p>I've also recently started using LastPass to store my work credentials as a way of keeping business and personal life separate. So far, LastPass has the most refined UI for managing user credentials. The website is further enhanced by adding a Chrome extension (thus meaning it can be used on all of the desktop platforms) as well as native mobile apps. I can't speak for iOS but on Android this app is a God-send. It taps into Android's accessibility features to allow it to monitor for password input fields. It injects the matching credentials very quickly and easily.</p>\n<p>The mobile app can use your device's fingerprint sensor to unlock your database. You can even store other things, like product licenses, ssh keys, and file attachements. Novemeber of 2016 LastPass also made it free to use its mobile client so its now easier to use it anyway.</p>\n<p>If you aren't using a password manager, I would recommend starting right now with LastPass.</p>\n<h3>Mobile interoperability</h3>\n<p>Nothing has changed on this front for me personally. While I'm still in envy about the iOS ecosystem and it's native interoperability, PushBullet still does the job for me. I use Mac anc Linux computers as well as Android and iOS mobile devices regularly.</p>\n<p>I did sign up for the T-Mobile DIGITS beta, but... that's a bit far from polished for my liking.</p>\n<h3>Terminal</h3>\n<p>I was unexpectedly pleased when I decided to try out <a href=\"https://github.com/zeit/hyper\">Hyper terminal</a>. Also built on Electron, this terminal wrapper has gained a lot of popularity which in turns means its plugin ecosystem is thriving. For example, you can enable mouse scrolling to get through long documents using <code>hyperterm-alternatescroll</code>; or make links clickable by holding down a key with <code>hyperlinks-iterm</code>. Because all of this is stored in a config file I pulled over my settings and preferences to my work computer with a simple copy/paste.</p>\n<h3>IDE</h3>\n<p>I have long since been a fan of the JetBrains suite of IDEs. They do a great job of pulling together many tools into one application. But I've found that for small side projects &#x26; demos it is very heavy and a little distracting. SublimeText and Atom are great simple solutions but VS Code has taken their place for me. VS Code provides a balance between simplicity and functionality, so its not overly simplistic right out of the box. Built in Git tools, console window, and debugger are <em>really</em> useful for getting hacking quickly. And of course, because its also an Electron app, its plugin ecosystem has whatever you might ask for. Here are the ones I use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Angular 2 TypeScript snippets</li>\n<li>Auto-open Markdown Preview</li>\n<li>Debugger for Chrome</li>\n<li>EditorConfig for VS Code</li>\n<li>Git History</li>\n<li>JavaScript (ES6) code snippets</li>\n<li>JSX</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fin</h2>\n<p>My objective here is just to give another perspective and voice to tools you might not have thought to try.

Additionally, CSSnext also includes <a href="https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer">Autoprefixer</a> as a dependency.</li>\n<li><code>postcss-import</code>: used to pull in a css file that wasn\'t being preprocessed</li>\n<li><code>cssnano</code>: minify and optimize output</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Install using yarn (or the npm equivalent)</p>\n<pre><code>yarn add -D normalize.css postcss-cli postcss-cssnext postcss-import cssnano\n</code></pre>\n<h3>PostCSS config</h3>\n<p>Create a json file that contains the config for PostCSS. The docs named it <strong>options.json</strong> but I choose <strong>postcss.json</strong> for better clarity. The comments below explain some keys.</p>\n<pre><code>{\n    // Enable plugins in order\n    "use": [\n        "postcss-import",\n        "postcss-cssnext",\n        "cssnano"\n    ],\n    "input": "main.css",\n    "output": "dist/main.css",\n    // use locally installed plugins (eg. in node_modules)\n    "local-plugins": true,\n    // Enable sourcemaps\n    "map": true,\n    // CSSnext and cssnano both use autoprefixer, but for different features/purposes\n    // see https://github.com/MoOx/postcss-cssnext/issues/323\n    "postcss-cssnext": {\n        "warnForDuplicates": false\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>CSS time</h3>\n<p>Go ahead and create <strong>main.css</strong> at the project root. The above config will output to <strong>dist/</strong>. Here\'s a quick sample to put into the file for now.</p>\n<pre><code>@import(\'normalize.css\');\n\n:root {\n    --color-primary: blue;\n    --color-secondary: red;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Building</h3>\n<p>Use the postcss-cli with the config file passed in as an arg and save it as an npm script.</p>\n<pre><code>"scripts": {\n    "build": "node_modules/postcss-cli/bin/postcss -c postcss.json"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now you can simply run <code>yarn run build</code> and your css will be processed and output to <strong>dist</strong>. But we can still do better.</p>\n<h3>Watch for changes</h3>\n<p>Enabling watch will auto-transform the css file on changes. Add another npm script, which is exactly the same as <code>build</code> but with the watch flag.</p>\n<pre><code>"build:dev": "node_modules/postcss-cli/bin/postcss -c postcss.json -w"\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Livereload</h3>\n<p>You wouldn\'t develop a CSS framework without seeing it rendered on a page so let\'s create a test page for development. Create <strong>index.html</strong> at the project root and populate it with some HTML, and add a link to your <strong>main.css</strong> file.</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;!doctype html>\n&#x3C;html lang="en-US">\n    &#x3C;head>\n        &#x3C;link rel="stylesheet" href="/dist/main.css">\n    &#x3C;/head>\n    &#x3C;body>\n        &#x3C;main>Hello world&#x3C;/main>\n    &#x3C;/body>\n&#x3C;/html>\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/lr-http-server"><code>lr-http-server</code></a> will reload on changes, as well as a functioning http server.</p>\n<pre><code>yarn add -D lr-http-server\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then register a new npm script for it</p>\n<pre><code>"reload": "lr-http-server -p 3000"\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Composing scripts</h3>\n<p>We want the two above scripts to run in parallel so that if either the css or the html file changes the livereload server will do its job. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all"><code>npm-run-all</code></a> with the <code>-p</code> (parallel) flag does this exactly.</p>\n<pre><code>yarn add -D npm-run-all\n</code></pre>\n<p>Join the two tasks together into a single npm script</p>\n<pre><code>"start": "npm-run-all -p build:dev reload"\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then run easily with</p>\n<pre><code>yarn start\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Done!</h3>\n<p>You\'re ready to keep going developing your styles inside <strong>main.css</strong>. Feel free to improve upon this as needed!</p>',id:"/Users/cfiloteo/dev/blog/src/pages/2017-02-14-build-a-css-framework-using-npm/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:4,frontmatter:{date:"2017-02-14T00:00:00.000Z",path:"/posts/build-a-css-framework-using-npm/",tags:["javascript","npm"],title:"Building a CSS framework using npm"}}],programming:[{excerpt:"Time has passed, technology has improved, and my preferences have also changed.

In this post I'll revisit my choice of tooling.</p>\n<h3>Password manager</h3>\n<p>Having put a password manager in place to store, generate, and access my passphrases has been one of the most beneficial tools I've been able to use in my day-to-day. KeePass has long been the standard for accomplishing this but the clients built around it have not kept up—at least not very well.</p>\n<h4>KeeWeb</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://keeweb.info/\">KeeWeb</a> is built with Electron and gives the KeePass standard a decent interface on Windows, MacOS, Linux, and even as a <a href=\"https://app.keeweb.info/\">web app</a>. It can sync with Google Drive, generate new passwords, and uses the same keyboard shortcuts as KeePassX and then some.</p>\n<p>The only problem with this app is maybe a bug: it's browser autofill feature seems to populate the browser URL bar with the site and password, rather than navigating to the site before pasting in the credentials. This means that my browser history could potentially have a password in plain text. Because this is such a huge no-no I never use this feature anymore.</p>\n<h4>LastPass</h4>\n<p>I've also recently started using LastPass to store my work credentials as a way of keeping business and personal life separate. So far, LastPass has the most refined UI for managing user credentials. The website is further enhanced by adding a Chrome extension (thus meaning it can be used on all of the desktop platforms) as well as native mobile apps. I can't speak for iOS but on Android this app is a God-send. It taps into Android's accessibility features to allow it to monitor for password input fields. It injects the matching credentials very quickly and easily.</p>\n<p>The mobile app can use your device's fingerprint sensor to unlock your database. You can even store other things, like product licenses, ssh keys, and file attachements. Novemeber of 2016 LastPass also made it free to use its mobile client so its now easier to use it anyway.</p>\n<p>If you aren't using a password manager, I would recommend starting right now with LastPass.</p>\n<h3>Mobile interoperability</h3>\n<p>Nothing has changed on this front for me personally. While I'm still in envy about the iOS ecosystem and it's native interoperability, PushBullet still does the job for me. I use Mac anc Linux computers as well as Android and iOS mobile devices regularly.</p>\n<p>I did sign up for the T-Mobile DIGITS beta, but... that's a bit far from polished for my liking.</p>\n<h3>Terminal</h3>\n<p>I was unexpectedly pleased when I decided to try out <a href=\"https://github.com/zeit/hyper\">Hyper terminal</a>. Also built on Electron, this terminal wrapper has gained a lot of popularity which in turns means its plugin ecosystem is thriving. For example, you can enable mouse scrolling to get through long documents using <code>hyperterm-alternatescroll</code>; or make links clickable by holding down a key with <code>hyperlinks-iterm</code>. Because all of this is stored in a config file I pulled over my settings and preferences to my work computer with a simple copy/paste.</p>\n<h3>IDE</h3>\n<p>I have long since been a fan of the JetBrains suite of IDEs. They do a great job of pulling together many tools into one application. But I've found that for small side projects &#x26; demos it is very heavy and a little distracting. SublimeText and Atom are great simple solutions but VS Code has taken their place for me. VS Code provides a balance between simplicity and functionality, so its not overly simplistic right out of the box. Built in Git tools, console window, and debugger are <em>really</em> useful for getting hacking quickly. And of course, because its also an Electron app, its plugin ecosystem has whatever you might ask for. Here are the ones I use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Angular 2 TypeScript snippets</li>\n<li>Auto-open Markdown Preview</li>\n<li>Debugger for Chrome</li>\n<li>EditorConfig for VS Code</li>\n<li>Git History</li>\n<li>JavaScript (ES6) code snippets</li>\n<li>JSX</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fin</h2>\n<p>My objective here is just to give another perspective and voice to tools you might not have thought to try. Have any questions?

Now, I\'m no expert but I do have experience with both Angular and React. This post lists some of the differences between the actual usage of Angular (2+) and React. I hope to just shed some light on the practical differences between them to help you understand the decision a bit better.</p>\n<h3>Complexity</h3>\n<p>Frameworks are abstractions to help reduce the complexity of building an application. Frameworks in turn introduce their own complexity. First, let\'s establish that each framework falls somewhere on a complexity spectrum.<a href="#vuejsTalk">¹</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is the first problem: <strong>React and Angular are at different points of the complexity spectrum</strong>. They\'re solving problems in different ways, and will never be equal to each other in scope. Using another analogy, they\'re different tools for different and various jobs; some of those jobs overlap, others don\'t.</p>\n<p>For the most part, choosing between them based on this alone is <strong>moot</strong>. Why? Because React is "unopinionated" so you bring your own solution to solve problem X. Inversely, Angular provides many tools together into one framework. It is not an apples-to-apples comparison.</p>\n<h4>Complexity: React</h4>\n<p>Let\'s start with React here. React is not a complete framework, you are required to bring in dependencies on your own. This is can be great but also daunting. Not all developers who work on the web know about the very latest libs, are proficient with <code>npm</code> or <code>yarn</code>, or can set up an ES6 project to transpile down to ES5.</p>\n<p>In an enterprise setting, choosing a library might need more consideration than "just because". Does the lib\'s license allow enterprise use? What if an engineering manager needs to know the difference between various libs? Which library contains enough features to support future projects/requirements?</p>\n<p>A personal experience of this I had is choosing an HTTP library. There are so many great choices! Some of the ones I\'ve looked at to use with React are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios">Axios</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent">Superagent</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird">Bluebird</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/github/fetch">Fetch</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/developit/unfetch">Unfetch</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The company I work for is slowly coming around to adopting React but what\'s there to stop each team from choosing a different lib from of the above? Allowing this sort of fragmentation makes it that much harder to share code and contribute to other teams. Furthermore, making a decision to standardize one requires intimate knowledge of the features, benefits, and disadvantages of each.</p>\n<p>Now, <em>this evaluation process isn\'t bad</em>! It would GREAT to make a thorough and informed decision but not every developer or team is equipped to make this kind of analysis for every dependency. If this isn\'t something that you or your team can or want to do, then consider a full framework like Angular. Conversely, if developers are passionate about jumping in and learning each lib quickly then this isn\'t a problem.</p>\n<h4>Complexity: Angular</h4>\n<p>With Angular you\'re getting many of libraries together from a single source, compatible and tested. Angular is an abstraction built on top of a component model, TypeScript, RxJS, Webpack, to name a few. The advantages I see here are:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Documentation exists showing how to use each lib within context of the framework</li>\n    <li>Each standard lib will be compatible and integrates better than external libs might</li>\n    <li>a solution is already "chosen" for you by the time you encounter a problem to be solved</li>\n    <li>Angular\'s implementation of semver means that most updates will follow a compatible rhythm</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are some disadvantages:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>You\'re getting a whole lot of framework to have to learn together, the learning curve here can be steep and overwhelming</li>\n    <li>Angular\'s documentation is not the very best</li>\n    <li>there\'s no sensibility in trying to replace one part of the framework for another lib</li>\n    <li>Full-frameworks can add in a lot of code that you don\'t use<sup>*</sup></li>\n    <li>Re-using the Angular namespace means that there\'s a lot of conflation between AngularJS (version 1) and Angular (2+)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><sup>*</sup>Both frameworks, if configured properly, discards unused dependencies from a production build (a process known as tree-shaking).</p>\n<h3>Framework</h3>\n<p>React\'s model of a single component drives to you really want to keep your components tiny, and import the rest. On average, my React components stay at less than 50 lines. Keeping components tiny really helps with composability.\nAngular uses a similar component model, but requires at least 10+ lines just to declare, along 2 accompanying files—a template file and a style file. Keeping the template separate has had an unforeseen consequence: templates get <em>huge</em> and end up more bloated than needed. Because of this, I feel like there\'s a desire to add more logic to the class than a single component actually needs. Its all to easy to bloat a single component instead of breaking it out into smaller pieces.</p>\n<h3>Tools</h3>\n<p>React has <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app">create-react-app</a>, a very small commandline tool to generate a React project. It\'s purposefully pretty bare bones and new features are only added with much consideration and discussion. In my subjective experience, I\'ve found that a sizable number of people chose to eject so that they have more control over their build config. This usually happens when they seek to include a feature/build step that CRA can\'t/won\'t include.</p>\n<p>Angular has the <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli">angular-cli</a>, a very functional commandline tool that pulls together a great number of useful features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Generator (like Yeoman)</li>\n<li>Dev server with live reload (using webpack-dev-server)</li>\n<li>Preconfigured css preprocessing (Sass, Less, or Stylus)</li>\n<li>Preconfigured linting (tslint)</li>\n<li>Preconfigured testing (Karma)</li>\n<li>Build configuration for dev &#x26; production</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Angular CLI has become much more robust and helps many devs quickly achieve things that might take much more manual configuration and experience. I\'ve very much enjoyed using the Angular CLI. The biggest issue I\'ve had with it are bad configurations: retroactive upgrades, version mismatches, or borked upgrades.</p>\n<h4>Ecosystem: React</h4>\n<p>React, backed by Facebook, has been favored by many developers and companies, like Microsoft and Samsung. React is the <strong>#1</strong> most-loved and 3rd most wanted framework<a href="#StackOverflowDeveloperSurvey2017">²</a> according to StackOverflow\'s 2017 Developer Survey. There are tons of React-based projects (this blog uses <a href="https://phenomic.io/">Phenomic</a>! 🤘 ) as well as React components. React\'s single-responsibility model has led to development of other great community-driven libraries that can enhance your app\'s functionality. Projects like <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">React Router</a>, <a href="http://redux.js.org/">Redux</a>/<a href="https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx">MobX</a>, and React Native have all sprouted and thrived under <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/869732167814848512">the big React tent</a>.</p>\n<p>Even more interesting, <a href="https://preactjs.com/">Preact</a> and <a href="https://infernojs.org/">Inferno</a> are <em>"almost drop-in"</em> alternatives that have same/similar API; I find that many developers using React have literally never heard of either 🤔 yet these can offer even better performance for many apps.</p>\n<p>React\'s ecosystem is as prolyfic as one could hope for.</p>\n<h4>Ecosystem: Angular</h4>\n<p>Angular on the other hand feels very much like "corporate" or enterprise softare. The API very much feels like <em>This is how we solved this problem, and you get to use it that way</em>. Regardless, adoption of Angular 2 has not lagged behind at all.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1.3 million people use Angular 1.<br>480k already use Angular 2.</p>&mdash; David East (@_davideast) <a href="https://twitter.com/_davideast/status/776244105261133824">September 15, 2016</a></blockquote>\n<script defer src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>\n<p>And this quote is somewhat old; these numbers have most likely increased. Angular ranks very high as a popular framework: 6th most loved, 4th most dreaded, and 2nd most wanted<a href="#StackOverflowDeveloperSurvey2017">²</a> <a href="#footnote2">³</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>The Angular ecosystem is not quite as expansive, but has Google\'s weight behind the rest of their products to push out additional libraries that align with Angular. What that means is companion projects like <a href="https://github.com/angular/material2">Angular Material</a>, <a href="https://github.com/angular/angularfire2">AngularFire2</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/angular/universal">Angular Universal</a> are kept up to date with the Angular core. Aside from these projects there aren\'t as many thriving projects built for Angular as I\'d like to see. Many of these have gotten out of date very fast.</p>\n<p>TypeScript has seen some great progress and adoption in the JS community as a whole; its the 3rd most loved and 6th most wanted language of 2017<a href="#StackOverflowDeveloperSurvey2017">²</a>! Furthermore, a success with TypeScript that I\'ve experienced is that it makes backend developers a more comfortable writing JavaScript. It enables bringing in some concepts that can help make a webapp more robust, in addition to being an ES6 transpiler. Learning TypeScript\'s features and syntax was not difficult.</p>\n<p>The most difficult part of using TypeScript is finding the correct type definitions (typings) to go along with your dependent libs. Most are available via npm under the <code>@types</code> namespace but if that isn\'t the case, you lose the main benefit of TypeScript in the first place: type safety. At the same time, that\'s no reason not to use Angular! It would make the developer all that better by taking the initiative to contribute the types. Yay for open source software! But this is a challege that you may face with Angular.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>This long-winded explanation is really just to say: Don\'t choose between React and Angular just because you\'re a fan of one. <strong>Choose the one that fits your project\'s requirements; the one whose risks and challenges you\'re willing to accept; the one that is the sane investment considering the needs of the developer, team, and business.</strong> Ultimately, both frameworks are backed by major companies. Both have great developers that lead them, and communities surrounding them. Both solve complex problems and can be used to build great web apps.</p>\n<p>If you can, don\'t lock yourself into one. Always keep learning about what else can solve the problem at hand. ✌️</p>\n<hr>\n<small>\nFootnotes:\n<ul>\n<li><a name="vuejsTalk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBBSp_iIiVM" target="_blank">1: "Vue.js: the Progressive Framework"</a></li>\n<li><a name="StackOverflowDeveloperSurvey2017" href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017" target="_blank">2: StackOverflow Developer Survey 2017</a></li>\n<li><a name="footnote2">3: </a> I don\'t think the survey properly distinguishes between AngularJS (version 1) and Angular (2+).
