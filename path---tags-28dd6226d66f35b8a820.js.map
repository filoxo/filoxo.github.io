My employer is a very place to work if you can get your foot in the door. This complaint is with the <strong>hiring process</strong> only. There are some major issues with the hiring process that have made me extremely frustrated, to the point where I want to gripe about it.</p>\\n<h3>Into the void</h3>\\n<p>I've had many people reach out to me about applying, and as a developer there isn't much more that I can do apart from give some general advice to prep for an interview and generating a referral.</p>\\n<p>The problem that has me furious is that after one of these individual applies, there's little to no follow up from company. Only 13% of my referrals ever even received a response. The rest have sat in our recruiting system(s) as \\\"inactive\\\" or \\\"pending recruiter response\\\". What bothers me about this is that this is polite and timely responses can be automated! Fire off an 'Application Received' email; send a 'Thank you for applying' once the position is closed; Deliver a 'Sorry about the lack of response' message if an application has sat for X weeks without any recruiter activity.</p>\\n<p>Because this is so easy with modern systems and common-place at other companies, I find it <strong>extremely rude and inconsiderate</strong> to prospective employees for this company. I've now begun letting people know that they may not hear back at all, ever. 👎</p>\\n<h3>Got Privilege? ✅</h3>\\n<p>Another seemingly arbitrary requirement is that applicants must have a college degree. Seriously. I recently heard some spew about \\\"attempting to attract only the best\\\" but this ignores the fact that this is a <em>very bad</em> policy for diversity &#x26; inclusion. The number of minorities (specifically hispanic and black) who graduate from college is far lower than white/Europeans.\\nI'm not trying to fight for affirmative action here, but this can lead to a form of candidate suppression: many qualified people are immediately excluded from the pool. There are so many individuals who are very smart and higher education wasn't in the cards for them. Real world experience and a proven track record is equally valuable in my experience.</p>\\n<p>Anectodally, I heard that an offer was <strong>reneged</strong> because the applicant didn't have a degree, regardless of their previous experience. WTF 😞</p>\\n<h3>Woe, woe, woe</h3>\\n<p>I <em>think</em> the main reason for this is because we have too few recruiters for the number of applicants. Our HR team is ~10 people in a company of 1500+ employees—that's less than 1%. As a developer, I don't know how many applications are received per opening but the two that I've been a part of have received 200+. That's a lot of work for such a small team! The above mentioned practices really aren't helping anything either. Its a people problem and a process problem.</p>\\n<p>Even more frustrating with the issue here is that there's nothing I can really do. Sure, I could talk to someone higher up. I've complained somewhat openly to my coworkers. But honestly, there's probably no real change that I can make. At least, not as a developer.</p>\\n<h3>On the bright side...</h3>\\n<p>Like I said at the beginning of this post, this company is <strong>great</strong> to work for if there was any possibility of being able to get an interview. I'm optimistic that the problems above are fairly easy to fix with just a few changes:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Setup automated communications</li>\\n<li>Find flaws in the application pipeline and solve</li>\\n<li>Hire more/better personnel</li>\\n<li>Remove the hard requirement of university degrees</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>I retain the hope that someday this company can better their hiring processes and become a place to which I would recommend any of my developer friends.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/cfiloteo/dev/filoblog/src/pages/2017-06-07-why-I-wont-recommend-my-employer/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"timeToRead\":3,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"2017-06-07T00:00:00.000Z\",\"path\":\"/posts/why-im-not-currently-recommending-my-employer\",\"tags\":[\"employment\"],\"title\":\"Why I won't recommend my employer\"}}],\"angular\":[{\"excerpt\":\"I sometimes see developers ask \\\"Should I use React, or Angular, or Vue.js, or  [ insert new framework here ] ?\\\" and every time, I see fanatics immediately jump to recommending one without any real justification.

Now, I'm no expert but I do have experience with both Angular and React. This post lists some of the differences between the actual usage of Angular (2+) and React. I hope to just shed some light on the practical differences between them to help you understand the decision a bit better.</p>\\n<h3>Complexity</h3>\\n<p>Frameworks are abstractions to help reduce the complexity of building an application. Frameworks in turn introduce their own complexity. First, let's establish that each framework falls somewhere on a complexity spectrum.<a href=\\\"#vuejsTalk\\\">¹</a></p>\\n<p></p>\\n<p>This is the first problem: <strong>React and Angular are at different points of the complexity spectrum</strong>. They're solving problems in different ways, and will never be equal to each other in scope. Using another analogy, they're different tools for different and various jobs; some of those jobs overlap, others don't.</p>\\n<p>For the most part, choosing between them based on this alone is <strong>moot</strong>. Why? Because React is \\\"unopinionated\\\" so you bring your own solution to solve problem X. Inversely, Angular provides many tools together into one framework. It is not an apples-to-apples comparison.</p>\\n<h4>Complexity: React</h4>\\n<p>Let's start with React here. React is not a complete framework, you are required to bring in dependencies on your own. This is can be great but also daunting. Not all developers who work on the web know about the very latest libs, are proficient with <code>npm</code> or <code>yarn</code>, or can set up an ES6 project to transpile down to ES5.</p>\\n<p>In an enterprise setting, choosing a library might need more consideration than \\\"just because\\\". Does the lib's license allow enterprise use? What if an engineering manager needs to know the difference between various libs? Which library contains enough features to support future projects/requirements?</p>\\n<p>A personal experience of this I had is choosing an HTTP library. There are so many great choices! Some of the ones I've looked at to use with React are:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios\\\">Axios</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent\\\">Superagent</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird\\\">Bluebird</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/github/fetch\\\">Fetch</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/developit/unfetch\\\">Unfetch</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The company I work for is slowly coming around to adopting React but what's there to stop each team from choosing a different lib from of the above? Allowing this sort of fragmentation makes it that much harder to share code and contribute to other teams. Furthermore, making a decision to standardize one requires intimate knowledge of the features, benefits, and disadvantages of each.</p>\\n<p>Now, <em>this evaluation process isn't bad</em>! It would GREAT to make a thorough and informed decision but not every developer or team is equipped to make this kind of analysis for every dependency. If this isn't something that you or your team can or want to do, then consider a full framework like Angular. Conversely, if developers are passionate about jumping in and learning each lib quickly then this isn't a problem.</p>\\n<h4>Complexity: Angular</h4>\\n<p>With Angular you're getting many of libraries together from a single source, compatible and tested. Angular is an abstraction built on top of a component model, TypeScript, RxJS, Webpack, to name a few. The advantages I see here are:</p>\\n<ul>\\n    <li>Documentation exists showing how to use each lib within context of the framework</li>\\n    <li>Each standard lib will be compatible and integrates better than external libs might</li>\\n    <li>a solution is already \\\"chosen\\\" for you by the time you encounter a problem to be solved</li>\\n    <li>Angular's implementation of semver means that most updates will follow a compatible rhythm</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>There are some disadvantages:</p>\\n<ul>\\n    <li>You're getting a whole lot of framework to have to learn together, the learning curve here can be steep and overwhelming</li>\\n    <li>Angular's documentation is not the very best</li>\\n    <li>there's no sensibility in trying to replace one part of the framework for another lib</li>\\n    <li>Full-frameworks can add in a lot of code that you don't use<sup>*</sup></li>\\n    <li>Re-using the Angular namespace means that there's a lot of conflation between AngularJS (version 1) and Angular (2+)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><sup>*</sup>Both frameworks, if configured properly, discards unused dependencies from a production build (a process known as tree-shaking).</p>\\n<h3>Framework</h3>\\n<p>React's model of a single component drives to you really want to keep your components tiny, and import the rest. On average, my React components stay at less than 50 lines. Keeping components tiny really helps with composability.\\nAngular uses a similar component model, but requires at least 10+ lines just to declare, along 2 accompanying files—a template file and a style file. Keeping the template separate has had an unforeseen consequence: templates get <em>huge</em> and end up more bloated than needed. Because of this, I feel like there's a desire to add more logic to the class than a single component actually needs. Its all to easy to bloat a single component instead of breaking it out into smaller pieces.</p>\\n<h3>Tools</h3>\\n<p>React has <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app\\\">create-react-app</a>, a very small commandline tool to generate a React project. It's purposefully pretty bare bones and new features are only added with much consideration and discussion. In my subjective experience, I've found that a sizable number of people chose to eject so that they have more control over their build config. This usually happens when they seek to include a feature/build step that CRA can't/won't include.</p>\\n<p>Angular has the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli\\\">angular-cli</a>, a very functional commandline tool that pulls together a great number of useful features:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Generator (like Yeoman)</li>\\n<li>Dev server with live reload (using webpack-dev-server)</li>\\n<li>Preconfigured css preprocessing (Sass, Less, or Stylus)</li>\\n<li>Preconfigured linting (tslint)</li>\\n<li>Preconfigured testing (Karma)</li>\\n<li>Build configuration for dev &#x26; production</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The Angular CLI has become much more robust and helps many devs quickly achieve things that might take much more manual configuration and experience. I've very much enjoyed using the Angular CLI. The biggest issue I've had with it are bad configurations: retroactive upgrades, version mismatches, or borked upgrades.</p>\\n<h4>Ecosystem: React</h4>\\n<p>React, backed by Facebook, has been favored by many developers and companies, like Microsoft and Samsung. React is the <strong>#1</strong> most-loved and 3rd most wanted framework<a href=\\\"#StackOverflowDeveloperSurvey2017\\\">²</a> according to StackOverflow's 2017 Developer Survey. There are tons of React-based projects (this blog uses <a href=\\\"https://phenomic.io/\\\">Phenomic</a>! 🤘 ) as well as React components. React's single-responsibility model has led to development of other great community-driven libraries that can enhance your app's functionality. Projects like <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router\\\">React Router</a>, <a href=\\\"http://redux.js.org/\\\">Redux</a>/<a href=\\\"https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx\\\">MobX</a>, and React Native have all sprouted and thrived under <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/869732167814848512\\\">the big React tent</a>.</p>\\n<p>Even more interesting, <a href=\\\"https://preactjs.com/\\\">Preact</a> and <a href=\\\"https://infernojs.org/\\\">Inferno</a> are <em>\\\"almost drop-in\\\"</em> alternatives that have same/similar API; I find that many developers using React have literally never heard of either 🤔 yet these can offer even better performance for many apps.</p>\\n<p>React's ecosystem is as prolyfic as one could hope for.</p>\\n<h4>Ecosystem: Angular</h4>\\n<p>Angular on the other hand feels very much like \\\"corporate\\\" or enterprise softare. The API very much feels like <em>This is how we solved this problem, and you get to use it that way</em>. Regardless, adoption of Angular 2 has not lagged behind at all.</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" data-lang=\\\"en\\\"><p lang=\\\"en\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">1.3 million people use Angular 1.<br>480k already use Angular 2.</p>&mdash; David East (@_davideast) <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/_davideast/status/776244105261133824\\\">September 15, 2016</a></blockquote>\\n<script defer src=\\\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\\\" charset=\\\"utf-8\\\"></script>\\n<p>And this quote is somewhat old; these numbers have most likely increased. Angular ranks very high as a popular framework: 6th most loved, 4th most dreaded, and 2nd most wanted<a href=\\\"#StackOverflowDeveloperSurvey2017\\\">²</a> <a href=\\\"#footnote2\\\">³</a></sup>.</p>\\n<p>The Angular ecosystem is not quite as expansive, but has Google's weight behind the rest of their products to push out additional libraries that align with Angular. What that means is companion projects like <a href=\\\"https://github.com/angular/material2\\\">Angular Material</a>, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/angular/angularfire2\\\">AngularFire2</a>, and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/angular/universal\\\">Angular Universal</a> are kept up to date with the Angular core. Aside from these projects there aren't as many thriving projects built for Angular as I'd like to see. Many of these have gotten out of date very fast.</p>\\n<p>TypeScript has seen some great progress and adoption in the JS community as a whole; its the 3rd most loved and 6th most wanted language of 2017<a href=\\\"#StackOverflowDeveloperSurvey2017\\\">²</a>! Furthermore, a success with TypeScript that I've experienced is that it makes backend developers a more comfortable writing JavaScript. It enables bringing in some concepts that can help make a webapp more robust, in addition to being an ES6 transpiler. Learning TypeScript's features and syntax was not difficult.</p>\\n<p>The most difficult part of using TypeScript is finding the correct type definitions (typings) to go along with your dependent libs. Most are available via npm under the <code>@types</code> namespace but if that isn't the case, you lose the main benefit of TypeScript in the first place: type safety. At the same time, that's no reason not to use Angular! It would make the developer all that better by taking the initiative to contribute the types. Yay for open source software! But this is a challege that you may face with Angular.</p>\\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\\n<p>This long-winded explanation is really just to say: Don't choose between React and Angular just because you're a fan of one. <strong>Choose the one that fits your project's requirements; the one whose risks and challenges you're willing to accept; the one that is the sane investment considering the needs of the developer, team, and business.</strong> Ultimately, both frameworks are backed by major companies. Both have great developers that lead them, and communities surrounding them. Both solve complex problems and can be used to build great web apps.</p>\\n<p>If you can, don't lock yourself into one. Always keep learning about what else can solve the problem at hand. ✌️</p>\\n<hr>\\n<small>\\nFootnotes:\\n<ul>\\n<li><a name=\\\"vuejsTalk\\\" href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBBSp_iIiVM\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">1: \\\"Vue.js: the Progressive Framework\\\"</a></li>\\n<li><a name=\\\"StackOverflowDeveloperSurvey2017\\\" href=\\\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">2: StackOverflow Developer Survey 2017</a></li>\\n<li><a name=\\\"footnote2\\\">3: </a> I don't think the survey properly distinguishes between AngularJS (version 1) and Angular (2+).

NgContent isn't well documented.</p>\\n<h3>Why isn't <code>ng-content</code> self-closing?</h3>\\n<p><code>ng-content</code> is to be used like any other element. This is great, especially for rendering in default content. For example, a component that can transclude some content but if for some reason nothing is nested into it, it will show a default state.</p>\\n<pre><code>&#x3C;profile-card>\\n    &#x3C;ng-content>\\n        &#x3C;img src=\\\"/defaultProfile.jpg\\\"/>\\n        &#x3C;p>Unknown&#x3C;/p>\\n    &#x3C;/ng-content>\\n&#x3C;/profile-card>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>But what if you don't need anything within the opening and closing tags? You'd think that just <code>&#x3C;ng-content /></code> would be a nice and simple way to signal where to place the included content, but attempting to do so generates the following error:</p>\\n<pre><code>Template parse errors: Only void and foreign elements can be self closed \\\"ng-content\\\"\\n[ERROR ->]&#x3C;ng-content />\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Seems weird to me. This may be by design.</p>\\n<h3>Select is only able to find immediate children?</h3>\\n<p>One of the features of <code>ng-content</code> is that you can use the <code>select</code> attribute on it to pull transcluded content into a specific location.</p>\\n<pre><code>&#x3C;!-- my-component.html -->\\n&#x3C;div>\\n    &#x3C;ng-content select=\\\".title\\\">&#x3C;/ng-content>\\n    &#x3C;ng-content select=\\\".subtitle\\\">&#x3C;/ng-content>\\n&#x3C;/div>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This is great for enforcing layout in a specific way. Except... it has a <strong>major</strong> caveat, at least in my opinion. This select only seems to match <em>immediate children only</em>, nothing else.</p>\\n<p>So using the above <code>my-component</code>, this belwo works while placing the <code>title</code> above the <code>subtitle</code>:</p>\\n<pre><code>&#x3C;my-component>\\n    &#x3C;p class=\\\"subtitle\\\">world&#x3C;/p>\\n    &#x3C;h2 class=\\\"title\\\">Hello&#x3C;/h2>\\n&#x3C;/my-component>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>but then this doesn't! Nothing is rendered.</p>\\n<pre><code>&#x3C;my-component>\\n    &#x3C;div>\\n        &#x3C;h2 class=\\\"title\\\">Hello&#x3C;/h2>\\n        &#x3C;p class=\\\"subtitle\\\">world&#x3C;/p>\\n    &#x3C;/div>\\n&#x3C;/my-component>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>It can't find these same elements  because they're wrapped in an extra div? I would have thought that it would match those elements as well, just like <code>querySelector</code> or CSS selectors would. If I only wanted immediate children I would have used something like <code>select=\\\"> .title\\\"</code>. My assumption that it used standard selectors is wrong? ¯\\\\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯ That sucks.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/cfiloteo/dev/filoblog/src/pages/2017-04-05-thoughts-on-angular-ng-content/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"timeToRead\":2,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"2017-04-05T00:00:00.000Z\",\"path\":\"/posts/thoughts-on-angular-ngcontent\",\"tags\":[\"angular\"],\"title\":\"Thoughts on Angular: Ng-Content\"}}],\"react\":[{\"excerpt\":\"I sometimes see developers ask \\\"Should I use React, or Angular, or Vue.js, or  [ insert new framework here ] ?\\\" and every time, I see fanatics immediately jump to recommending one without any real justification.

Now, I'm no expert but I do have experience with both Angular and React. This post lists some of the differences between the actual usage of Angular (2+) and React. I hope to just shed some light on the practical differences between them to help you understand the decision a bit better.</p>\\n<h3>Complexity</h3>\\n<p>Frameworks are abstractions to help reduce the complexity of building an application. Frameworks in turn introduce their own complexity. First, let's establish that each framework falls somewhere on a complexity spectrum.<a href=\\\"#vuejsTalk\\\">¹</a></p>\\n<p></p>\\n<p>This is the first problem: <strong>React and Angular are at different points of the complexity spectrum</strong>. They're solving problems in different ways, and will never be equal to each other in scope. Using another analogy, they're different tools for different and various jobs; some of those jobs overlap, others don't.</p>\\n<p>For the most part, choosing between them based on this alone is <strong>moot</strong>. Why? Because React is \\\"unopinionated\\\" so you bring your own solution to solve problem X. Inversely, Angular provides many tools together into one framework. It is not an apples-to-apples comparison.</p>\\n<h4>Complexity: React</h4>\\n<p>Let's start with React here. React is not a complete framework, you are required to bring in dependencies on your own. This is can be great but also daunting. Not all developers who work on the web know about the very latest libs, are proficient with <code>npm</code> or <code>yarn</code>, or can set up an ES6 project to transpile down to ES5.</p>\\n<p>In an enterprise setting, choosing a library might need more consideration than \\\"just because\\\". Does the lib's license allow enterprise use? What if an engineering manager needs to know the difference between various libs? Which library contains enough features to support future projects/requirements?</p>\\n<p>A personal experience of this I had is choosing an HTTP library. There are so many great choices! Some of the ones I've looked at to use with React are:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios\\\">Axios</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent\\\">Superagent</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird\\\">Bluebird</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/github/fetch\\\">Fetch</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/developit/unfetch\\\">Unfetch</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The company I work for is slowly coming around to adopting React but what's there to stop each team from choosing a different lib from of the above? Allowing this sort of fragmentation makes it that much harder to share code and contribute to other teams. Furthermore, making a decision to standardize one requires intimate knowledge of the features, benefits, and disadvantages of each.</p>\\n<p>Now, <em>this evaluation process isn't bad</em>! It would GREAT to make a thorough and informed decision but not every developer or team is equipped to make this kind of analysis for every dependency. If this isn't something that you or your team can or want to do, then consider a full framework like Angular. Conversely, if developers are passionate about jumping in and learning each lib quickly then this isn't a problem.</p>\\n<h4>Complexity: Angular</h4>\\n<p>With Angular you're getting many of libraries together from a single source, compatible and tested. Angular is an abstraction built on top of a component model, TypeScript, RxJS, Webpack, to name a few. The advantages I see here are:</p>\\n<ul>\\n    <li>Documentation exists showing how to use each lib within context of the framework</li>\\n    <li>Each standard lib will be compatible and integrates better than external libs might</li>\\n    <li>a solution is already \\\"chosen\\\" for you by the time you encounter a problem to be solved</li>\\n    <li>Angular's implementation of semver means that most updates will follow a compatible rhythm</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>There are some disadvantages:</p>\\n<ul>\\n    <li>You're getting a whole lot of framework to have to learn together, the learning curve here can be steep and overwhelming</li>\\n    <li>Angular's documentation is not the very best</li>\\n    <li>there's no sensibility in trying to replace one part of the framework for another lib</li>\\n    <li>Full-frameworks can add in a lot of code that you don't use<sup>*</sup></li>\\n    <li>Re-using the Angular namespace means that there's a lot of conflation between AngularJS (version 1) and Angular (2+)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><sup>*</sup>Both frameworks, if configured properly, discards unused dependencies from a production build (a process known as tree-shaking).</p>\\n<h3>Framework</h3>\\n<p>React's model of a single component drives to you really want to keep your components tiny, and import the rest. On average, my React components stay at less than 50 lines. Keeping components tiny really helps with composability.\\nAngular uses a similar component model, but requires at least 10+ lines just to declare, along 2 accompanying files—a template file and a style file. Keeping the template separate has had an unforeseen consequence: templates get <em>huge</em> and end up more bloated than needed. Because of this, I feel like there's a desire to add more logic to the class than a single component actually needs. Its all to easy to bloat a single component instead of breaking it out into smaller pieces.</p>\\n<h3>Tools</h3>\\n<p>React has <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app\\\">create-react-app</a>, a very small commandline tool to generate a React project. It's purposefully pretty bare bones and new features are only added with much consideration and discussion. In my subjective experience, I've found that a sizable number of people chose to eject so that they have more control over their build config. This usually happens when they seek to include a feature/build step that CRA can't/won't include.</p>\\n<p>Angular has the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli\\\">angular-cli</a>, a very functional commandline tool that pulls together a great number of useful features:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Generator (like Yeoman)</li>\\n<li>Dev server with live reload (using webpack-dev-server)</li>\\n<li>Preconfigured css preprocessing (Sass, Less, or Stylus)</li>\\n<li>Preconfigured linting (tslint)</li>\\n<li>Preconfigured testing (Karma)</li>\\n<li>Build configuration for dev &#x26; production</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The Angular CLI has become much more robust and helps many devs quickly achieve things that might take much more manual configuration and experience. I've very much enjoyed using the Angular CLI. The biggest issue I've had with it are bad configurations: retroactive upgrades, version mismatches, or borked upgrades.</p>\\n<h4>Ecosystem: React</h4>\\n<p>React, backed by Facebook, has been favored by many developers and companies, like Microsoft and Samsung. React is the <strong>#1</strong> most-loved and 3rd most wanted framework<a href=\\\"#StackOverflowDeveloperSurvey2017\\\">²</a> according to StackOverflow's 2017 Developer Survey. There are tons of React-based projects (this blog uses <a href=\\\"https://phenomic.io/\\\">Phenomic</a>! 🤘 ) as well as React components. React's single-responsibility model has led to development of other great community-driven libraries that can enhance your app's functionality. Projects like <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router\\\">React Router</a>, <a href=\\\"http://redux.js.org/\\\">Redux</a>/<a href=\\\"https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx\\\">MobX</a>, and React Native have all sprouted and thrived under <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/869732167814848512\\\">the big React tent</a>.</p>\\n<p>Even more interesting, <a href=\\\"https://preactjs.com/\\\">Preact</a> and <a href=\\\"https://infernojs.org/\\\">Inferno</a> are <em>\\\"almost drop-in\\\"</em> alternatives that have same/similar API; I find that many developers using React have literally never heard of either 🤔 yet these can offer even better performance for many apps.</p>\\n<p>React's ecosystem is as prolyfic as one could hope for.</p>\\n<h4>Ecosystem: Angular</h4>\\n<p>Angular on the other hand feels very much like \\\"corporate\\\" or enterprise softare. The API very much feels like <em>This is how we solved this problem, and you get to use it that way</em>. Regardless, adoption of Angular 2 has not lagged behind at all.</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" data-lang=\\\"en\\\"><p lang=\\\"en\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">1.3 million people use Angular 1.<br>480k already use Angular 2.</p>&mdash; David East (@_davideast) <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/_davideast/status/776244105261133824\\\">September 15, 2016</a></blockquote>\\n<script defer src=\\\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\\\" charset=\\\"utf-8\\\"></script>\\n<p>And this quote is somewhat old; these numbers have most likely increased. Angular ranks very high as a popular framework: 6th most loved, 4th most dreaded, and 2nd most wanted<a href=\\\"#StackOverflowDeveloperSurvey2017\\\">²</a> <a href=\\\"#footnote2\\\">³</a></sup>.</p>\\n<p>The Angular ecosystem is not quite as expansive, but has Google's weight behind the rest of their products to push out additional libraries that align with Angular. What that means is companion projects like <a href=\\\"https://github.com/angular/material2\\\">Angular Material</a>, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/angular/angularfire2\\\">AngularFire2</a>, and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/angular/universal\\\">Angular Universal</a> are kept up to date with the Angular core. Aside from these projects there aren't as many thriving projects built for Angular as I'd like to see. Many of these have gotten out of date very fast.</p>\\n<p>TypeScript has seen some great progress and adoption in the JS community as a whole; its the 3rd most loved and 6th most wanted language of 2017<a href=\\\"#StackOverflowDeveloperSurvey2017\\\">²</a>! Furthermore, a success with TypeScript that I've experienced is that it makes backend developers a more comfortable writing JavaScript. It enables bringing in some concepts that can help make a webapp more robust, in addition to being an ES6 transpiler. Learning TypeScript's features and syntax was not difficult.</p>\\n<p>The most difficult part of using TypeScript is finding the correct type definitions (typings) to go along with your dependent libs. Most are available via npm under the <code>@types</code> namespace but if that isn't the case, you lose the main benefit of TypeScript in the first place: type safety. At the same time, that's no reason not to use Angular! It would make the developer all that better by taking the initiative to contribute the types. Yay for open source software! But this is a challege that you may face with Angular.</p>\\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\\n<p>This long-winded explanation is really just to say: Don't choose between React and Angular just because you're a fan of one. <strong>Choose the one that fits your project's requirements; the one whose risks and challenges you're willing to accept; the one that is the sane investment considering the needs of the developer, team, and business.</strong> Ultimately, both frameworks are backed by major companies. Both have great developers that lead them, and communities surrounding them. Both solve complex problems and can be used to build great web apps.</p>\\n<p>If you can, don't lock yourself into one. Always keep learning about what else can solve the problem at hand. ✌️</p>\\n<hr>\\n<small>\\nFootnotes:\\n<ul>\\n<li><a name=\\\"vuejsTalk\\\" href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBBSp_iIiVM\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">1: \\\"Vue.js: the Progressive Framework\\\"</a></li>\\n<li><a name=\\\"StackOverflowDeveloperSurvey2017\\\" href=\\\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">2: StackOverflow Developer Survey 2017</a></li>\\n<li><a name=\\\"footnote2\\\">3: </a> I don't think the survey properly distinguishes between AngularJS (version 1) and Angular (2+).

This way the code will be a little more future-proof. Additionally, CSSnext also includes <a href=\\\"https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer\\\">Autoprefixer</a> as a dependency.</li>\\n<li><code>postcss-import</code>: used to pull in a css file that wasn't being preprocessed</li>\\n<li><code>cssnano</code>: minify and optimize output</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Install using yarn (or the npm equivalent)</p>\\n<pre><code>yarn add -D normalize.css postcss-cli postcss-cssnext postcss-import cssnano\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>PostCSS config</h3>\\n<p>Create a json file that contains the config for PostCSS. The docs named it <strong>options.json</strong> but I choose <strong>postcss.json</strong> for better clarity. The comments below explain some keys.</p>\\n<pre><code>{\\n    // Enable plugins in order\\n    \\\"use\\\": [\\n        \\\"postcss-import\\\",\\n        \\\"postcss-cssnext\\\",\\n        \\\"cssnano\\\"\\n    ],\\n    \\\"input\\\": \\\"main.css\\\",\\n    \\\"output\\\": \\\"dist/main.css\\\",\\n    // use locally installed plugins (eg. in node_modules)\\n    \\\"local-plugins\\\": true,\\n    // Enable sourcemaps\\n    \\\"map\\\": true,\\n    // CSSnext and cssnano both use autoprefixer, but for different features/purposes\\n    // see https://github.com/MoOx/postcss-cssnext/issues/323\\n    \\\"postcss-cssnext\\\": {\\n        \\\"warnForDuplicates\\\": false\\n    }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>CSS time</h3>\\n<p>Go ahead and create <strong>main.css</strong> at the project root. The above config will output to <strong>dist/</strong>. Here's a quick sample to put into the file for now.</p>\\n<pre><code>@import('normalize.css');\\n\\n:root {\\n    --color-primary: blue;\\n    --color-secondary: red;\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Building</h3>\\n<p>Use the postcss-cli with the config file passed in as an arg and save it as an npm script.</p>\\n<pre><code>\\\"scripts\\\": {\\n    \\\"build\\\": \\\"node_modules/postcss-cli/bin/postcss -c postcss.json\\\"\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now you can simply run <code>yarn run build</code> and your css will be processed and output to <strong>dist</strong>. But we can still do better.</p>\\n<h3>Watch for changes</h3>\\n<p>Enabling watch will auto-transform the css file on changes. Add another npm script, which is exactly the same as <code>build</code> but with the watch flag.</p>\\n<pre><code>\\\"build:dev\\\": \\\"node_modules/postcss-cli/bin/postcss -c postcss.json -w\\\"\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Livereload</h3>\\n<p>You wouldn't develop a CSS framework without seeing it rendered on a page so let's create a test page for development. Create <strong>index.html</strong> at the project root and populate it with some HTML, and add a link to your <strong>main.css</strong> file.</p>\\n<pre><code>&#x3C;!doctype html>\\n&#x3C;html lang=\\\"en-US\\\">\\n    &#x3C;head>\\n        &#x3C;link rel=\\\"stylesheet\\\" href=\\\"/dist/main.css\\\">\\n    &#x3C;/head>\\n    &#x3C;body>\\n        &#x3C;main>Hello world&#x3C;/main>\\n    &#x3C;/body>\\n&#x3C;/html>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/lr-http-server\\\"><code>lr-http-server</code></a> will reload on changes, as well as a functioning http server.</p>\\n<pre><code>yarn add -D lr-http-server\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>And then register a new npm script for it</p>\\n<pre><code>\\\"reload\\\": \\\"lr-http-server -p 3000\\\"\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Composing scripts</h3>\\n<p>We want the two above scripts to run in parallel so that if either the css or the html file changes the livereload server will do its job. <a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all\\\"><code>npm-run-all</code></a> with the <code>-p</code> (parallel) flag does this exactly.</p>\\n<pre><code>yarn add -D npm-run-all\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Join the two tasks together into a single npm script</p>\\n<pre><code>\\\"start\\\": \\\"npm-run-all -p build:dev reload\\\"\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>And then run easily with</p>\\n<pre><code>yarn start\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Done!</h3>\\n<p>You're ready to keep going developing your styles inside <strong>main.css</strong>.

In this post I'll revisit my choice of tooling.</p>\\n<h3>Password manager</h3>\\n<p>Having put a password manager in place to store, generate, and access my passphrases has been one of the most beneficial tools I've been able to use in my day-to-day. KeePass has long been the standard for accomplishing this but the clients built around it have not kept up—at least not very well.</p>\\n<h4>KeeWeb</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://keeweb.info/\\\">KeeWeb</a> is built with Electron and gives the KeePass standard a decent interface on Windows, MacOS, Linux, and even as a <a href=\\\"https://app.keeweb.info/\\\">web app</a>. It can sync with Google Drive, generate new passwords, and uses the same keyboard shortcuts as KeePassX and then some.</p>\\n<p>The only problem with this app is maybe a bug: it's browser autofill feature seems to populate the browser URL bar with the site and password, rather than navigating to the site before pasting in the credentials. This means that my browser history could potentially have a password in plain text. Because this is such a huge no-no I never use this feature anymore.</p>\\n<h4>LastPass</h4>\\n<p>I've also recently started using LastPass to store my work credentials as a way of keeping business and personal life separate. So far, LastPass has the most refined UI for managing user credentials. The website is further enhanced by adding a Chrome extension (thus meaning it can be used on all of the desktop platforms) as well as native mobile apps. I can't speak for iOS but on Android this app is a God-send. It taps into Android's accessibility features to allow it to monitor for password input fields. It injects the matching credentials very quickly and easily.</p>\\n<p>The mobile app can use your device's fingerprint sensor to unlock your database. You can even store other things, like product licenses, ssh keys, and file attachements. Novemeber of 2016 LastPass also made it free to use its mobile client so its now easier to use it anyway.</p>\\n<p>If you aren't using a password manager, I would recommend starting right now with LastPass.</p>\\n<h3>Mobile interoperability</h3>\\n<p>Nothing has changed on this front for me personally. While I'm still in envy about the iOS ecosystem and it's native interoperability, PushBullet still does the job for me. I use Mac anc Linux computers as well as Android and iOS mobile devices regularly.</p>\\n<p>I did sign up for the T-Mobile DIGITS beta, but... that's a bit far from polished for my liking.</p>\\n<h3>Terminal</h3>\\n<p>I was unexpectedly pleased when I decided to try out <a href=\\\"https://github.com/zeit/hyper\\\">Hyper terminal</a>. Also built on Electron, this terminal wrapper has gained a lot of popularity which in turns means its plugin ecosystem is thriving. For example, you can enable mouse scrolling to get through long documents using <code>hyperterm-alternatescroll</code>; or make links clickable by holding down a key with <code>hyperlinks-iterm</code>. Because all of this is stored in a config file I pulled over my settings and preferences to my work computer with a simple copy/paste.</p>\\n<h3>IDE</h3>\\n<p>I have long since been a fan of the JetBrains suite of IDEs. They do a great job of pulling together many tools into one application. But I've found that for small side projects &#x26; demos it is very heavy and a little distracting. SublimeText and Atom are great simple solutions but VS Code has taken their place for me. VS Code provides a balance between simplicity and functionality, so its not overly simplistic right out of the box. Built in Git tools, console window, and debugger are <em>really</em> useful for getting hacking quickly. And of course, because its also an Electron app, its plugin ecosystem has whatever you might ask for. Here are the ones I use:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Angular 2 TypeScript snippets</li>\\n<li>Auto-open Markdown Preview</li>\\n<li>Debugger for Chrome</li>\\n<li>EditorConfig for VS Code</li>\\n<li>Git History</li>\\n<li>JavaScript (ES6) code snippets</li>\\n<li>JSX</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Fin</h2>\\n<p>My objective here is just to give another perspective and voice to tools you might not have thought to try.

But I can \\\"listen in\\\" on their public conversations and chime in when I have something to offer.</p>\\n<p>I've grouped these people by the main topics they talk about.</p>\\n<h4>Javascript</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/Una\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Una Kraveats</a> - UI eng, podcaster, artist</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/marcysutton\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Marcy Sutton</a> - Sr A11Y engineer &#x26; guru</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/sarah_edo\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Sarah Drasner</a> - Sr developer, speaker/writer</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/_ericelliott\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Eric Elliott</a> - practical advice, smart writing</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/mpjme\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Mattias Johansson</a> - also check out his Youtube channel, 'Fun Fun Function'</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>React</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/dan_abramov\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Dan Abramov</a> - Redux author, wise OSS contributor</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/ryanflorence\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Ryan Florence</a> - main contributor to React Router</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/mjackson\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Michael Jackson</a> - main contributor to React Router</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/thejameskyle\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">James Kyle</a> - Huge OSS contributor</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/kentcdodds\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Kent Dodds</a> - all around savvy guy</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/ken_wheeler\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Ken Wheeler</a> - OSS contributor, \\\"drunk cool uncle\\\" type</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Angular 2</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/victorsavkin\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Victor Savkin</a> - main architect of Angular Router</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/gdi2290\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Patrick Stapleton</a> - contributor to Angular Universal, Angular Class</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>News</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/JavaScriptDaily\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">JS Daily</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/frontendfront\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Front-End Front</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Tools</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/ChromiumDev\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Chrome Developers</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/eggheadio\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Egghead.io</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>I'm sure I missed some people on this list. It can't be comprehensive. But hopefully its a start for you.</p>\\n<p>Consider also following any of the accounts for meetups in your local area. For example, here in Utah where I live, <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/utjs\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">UtahJS</a>, <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/reactjsutah\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">ReactJS Utah</a>, <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/IonicUtah\\\" class=\\\"link\\\">Ionic Utah</a> are on my radar too.</p>\\n<h2>Blogs</h2>\\n<p>Blogs are great for laying out a lot of content/ideas so they take more time to consume. Time is of the essence and I generally won't read a blog post unless its very interesting to me.

Additionally, CSSnext also includes <a href=\\\"https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer\\\">Autoprefixer</a> as a dependency.</li>\\n<li><code>postcss-import</code>: used to pull in a css file that wasn't being preprocessed</li>\\n<li><code>cssnano</code>: minify and optimize output</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Install using yarn (or the npm equivalent)</p>\\n<pre><code>yarn add -D normalize.css postcss-cli postcss-cssnext postcss-import cssnano\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>PostCSS config</h3>\\n<p>Create a json file that contains the config for PostCSS. The docs named it <strong>options.json</strong> but I choose <strong>postcss.json</strong> for better clarity. The comments below explain some keys.</p>\\n<pre><code>{\\n    // Enable plugins in order\\n    \\\"use\\\": [\\n        \\\"postcss-import\\\",\\n        \\\"postcss-cssnext\\\",\\n        \\\"cssnano\\\"\\n    ],\\n    \\\"input\\\": \\\"main.css\\\",\\n    \\\"output\\\": \\\"dist/main.css\\\",\\n    // use locally installed plugins (eg. in node_modules)\\n    \\\"local-plugins\\\": true,\\n    // Enable sourcemaps\\n    \\\"map\\\": true,\\n    // CSSnext and cssnano both use autoprefixer, but for different features/purposes\\n    // see https://github.com/MoOx/postcss-cssnext/issues/323\\n    \\\"postcss-cssnext\\\": {\\n        \\\"warnForDuplicates\\\": false\\n    }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>CSS time</h3>\\n<p>Go ahead and create <strong>main.css</strong> at the project root. The above config will output to <strong>dist/</strong>. Here's a quick sample to put into the file for now.</p>\\n<pre><code>@import('normalize.css');\\n\\n:root {\\n    --color-primary: blue;\\n    --color-secondary: red;\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Building</h3>\\n<p>Use the postcss-cli with the config file passed in as an arg and save it as an npm script.</p>\\n<pre><code>\\\"scripts\\\": {\\n    \\\"build\\\": \\\"node_modules/postcss-cli/bin/postcss -c postcss.json\\\"\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now you can simply run <code>yarn run build</code> and your css will be processed and output to <strong>dist</strong>. But we can still do better.</p>\\n<h3>Watch for changes</h3>\\n<p>Enabling watch will auto-transform the css file on changes. Add another npm script, which is exactly the same as <code>build</code> but with the watch flag.</p>\\n<pre><code>\\\"build:dev\\\": \\\"node_modules/postcss-cli/bin/postcss -c postcss.json -w\\\"\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Livereload</h3>\\n<p>You wouldn't develop a CSS framework without seeing it rendered on a page so let's create a test page for development. Create <strong>index.html</strong> at the project root and populate it with some HTML, and add a link to your <strong>main.css</strong> file.</p>\\n<pre><code>&#x3C;!doctype html>\\n&#x3C;html lang=\\\"en-US\\\">\\n    &#x3C;head>\\n        &#x3C;link rel=\\\"stylesheet\\\" href=\\\"/dist/main.css\\\">\\n    &#x3C;/head>\\n    &#x3C;body>\\n        &#x3C;main>Hello world&#x3C;/main>\\n    &#x3C;/body>\\n&#x3C;/html>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/lr-http-server\\\"><code>lr-http-server</code></a> will reload on changes, as well as a functioning http server.</p>\\n<pre><code>yarn add -D lr-http-server\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>And then register a new npm script for it</p>\\n<pre><code>\\\"reload\\\": \\\"lr-http-server -p 3000\\\"\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Composing scripts</h3>\\n<p>We want the two above scripts to run in parallel so that if either the css or the html file changes the livereload server will do its job. <a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all\\\"><code>npm-run-all</code></a> with the <code>-p</code> (parallel) flag does this exactly.</p>\\n<pre><code>yarn add -D npm-run-all\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Join the two tasks together into a single npm script</p>\\n<pre><code>\\\"start\\\": \\\"npm-run-all -p build:dev reload\\\"\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>And then run easily with</p>\\n<pre><code>yarn start\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Done!</h3>\\n<p>You're ready to keep going developing your styles inside <strong>main.css</strong>. Feel free to improve upon this as needed!</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/cfiloteo/dev/filoblog/src/pages/2017-02-14-build-a-css-framework-using-npm/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"timeToRead\":4,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"2017-02-14T00:00:00.000Z\",\"path\":\"/posts/build-a-css-framework-using-npm/\",\"tags\":[\"javascript\",\"npm\"],\"title\":\"Building a CSS framework using npm\"}}],\"programming\":[{\"excerpt\":\"Time has passed, technology has improved, and my preferences have also changed.

In this post I'll revisit my choice of tooling.</p>\\n<h3>Password manager</h3>\\n<p>Having put a password manager in place to store, generate, and access my passphrases has been one of the most beneficial tools I've been able to use in my day-to-day. KeePass has long been the standard for accomplishing this but the clients built around it have not kept up—at least not very well.</p>\\n<h4>KeeWeb</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://keeweb.info/\\\">KeeWeb</a> is built with Electron and gives the KeePass standard a decent interface on Windows, MacOS, Linux, and even as a <a href=\\\"https://app.keeweb.info/\\\">web app</a>. It can sync with Google Drive, generate new passwords, and uses the same keyboard shortcuts as KeePassX and then some.</p>\\n<p>The only problem with this app is maybe a bug: it's browser autofill feature seems to populate the browser URL bar with the site and password, rather than navigating to the site before pasting in the credentials. This means that my browser history could potentially have a password in plain text. Because this is such a huge no-no I never use this feature anymore.</p>\\n<h4>LastPass</h4>\\n<p>I've also recently started using LastPass to store my work credentials as a way of keeping business and personal life separate. So far, LastPass has the most refined UI for managing user credentials. The website is further enhanced by adding a Chrome extension (thus meaning it can be used on all of the desktop platforms) as well as native mobile apps. I can't speak for iOS but on Android this app is a God-send. It taps into Android's accessibility features to allow it to monitor for password input fields. It injects the matching credentials very quickly and easily.</p>\\n<p>The mobile app can use your device's fingerprint sensor to unlock your database. You can even store other things, like product licenses, ssh keys, and file attachements. Novemeber of 2016 LastPass also made it free to use its mobile client so its now easier to use it anyway.</p>\\n<p>If you aren't using a password manager, I would recommend starting right now with LastPass.</p>\\n<h3>Mobile interoperability</h3>\\n<p>Nothing has changed on this front for me personally. While I'm still in envy about the iOS ecosystem and it's native interoperability, PushBullet still does the job for me. I use Mac anc Linux computers as well as Android and iOS mobile devices regularly.</p>\\n<p>I did sign up for the T-Mobile DIGITS beta, but... that's a bit far from polished for my liking.</p>\\n<h3>Terminal</h3>\\n<p>I was unexpectedly pleased when I decided to try out <a href=\\\"https://github.com/zeit/hyper\\\">Hyper terminal</a>. Also built on Electron, this terminal wrapper has gained a lot of popularity which in turns means its plugin ecosystem is thriving. For example, you can enable mouse scrolling to get through long documents using <code>hyperterm-alternatescroll</code>; or make links clickable by holding down a key with <code>hyperlinks-iterm</code>. Because all of this is stored in a config file I pulled over my settings and preferences to my work computer with a simple copy/paste.</p>\\n<h3>IDE</h3>\\n<p>I have long since been a fan of the JetBrains suite of IDEs. They do a great job of pulling together many tools into one application. But I've found that for small side projects &#x26; demos it is very heavy and a little distracting. SublimeText and Atom are great simple solutions but VS Code has taken their place for me. VS Code provides a balance between simplicity and functionality, so its not overly simplistic right out of the box. Built in Git tools, console window, and debugger are <em>really</em> useful for getting hacking quickly. And of course, because its also an Electron app, its plugin ecosystem has whatever you might ask for. Here are the ones I use:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Angular 2 TypeScript snippets</li>\\n<li>Auto-open Markdown Preview</li>\\n<li>Debugger for Chrome</li>\\n<li>EditorConfig for VS Code</li>\\n<li>Git History</li>\\n<li>JavaScript (ES6) code snippets</li>\\n<li>JSX</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Fin</h2>\\n<p>My objective here is just to give another perspective and voice to tools you might not have thought to try. Have any questions?

My employer is a very place to work if you can get your foot in the door. This complaint is with the <strong>hiring process</strong> only. There are some major issues with the hiring process that have made me extremely frustrated, to the point where I want to gripe about it.</p>\\n<h3>Into the void</h3>\\n<p>I've had many people reach out to me about applying, and as a developer there isn't much more that I can do apart from give some general advice to prep for an interview and generating a referral.</p>\\n<p>The problem that has me furious is that after one of these individual applies, there's little to no follow up from company. Only 13% of my referrals ever even received a response. The rest have sat in our recruiting system(s) as \\\"inactive\\\" or \\\"pending recruiter response\\\". What bothers me about this is that this is polite and timely responses can be automated! Fire off an 'Application Received' email; send a 'Thank you for applying' once the position is closed; Deliver a 'Sorry about the lack of response' message if an application has sat for X weeks without any recruiter activity.</p>\\n<p>Because this is so easy with modern systems and common-place at other companies, I find it <strong>extremely rude and inconsiderate</strong> to prospective employees for this company. I've now begun letting people know that they may not hear back at all, ever. 👎</p>\\n<h3>Got Privilege? ✅</h3>\\n<p>Another seemingly arbitrary requirement is that applicants must have a college degree. Seriously. I recently heard some spew about \\\"attempting to attract only the best\\\" but this ignores the fact that this is a <em>very bad</em> policy for diversity &#x26; inclusion. The number of minorities (specifically hispanic and black) who graduate from college is far lower than white/Europeans.\\nI'm not trying to fight for affirmative action here, but this can lead to a form of candidate suppression: many qualified people are immediately excluded from the pool. There are so many individuals who are very smart and higher education wasn't in the cards for them. Real world experience and a proven track record is equally valuable in my experience.</p>\\n<p>Anectodally, I heard that an offer was <strong>reneged</strong> because the applicant didn't have a degree, regardless of their previous experience. WTF 😞</p>\\n<h3>Woe, woe, woe</h3>\\n<p>I <em>think</em> the main reason for this is because we have too few recruiters for the number of applicants. Our HR team is ~10 people in a company of 1500+ employees—that's less than 1%. As a developer, I don't know how many applications are received per opening but the two that I've been a part of have received 200+. That's a lot of work for such a small team! The above mentioned practices really aren't helping anything either. Its a people problem and a process problem.</p>\\n<p>Even more frustrating with the issue here is that there's nothing I can really do. Sure, I could talk to someone higher up. I've complained somewhat openly to my coworkers. But honestly, there's probably no real change that I can make. At least, not as a developer.</p>\\n<h3>On the bright side...</h3>\\n<p>Like I said at the beginning of this post, this company is <strong>great</strong> to work for if there was any possibility of being able to get an interview. I'm optimistic that the problems above are fairly easy to fix with just a few changes:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Setup automated communications</li>\\n<li>Find flaws in the application pipeline and solve</li>\\n<li>Hire more/better personnel</li>\\n<li>Remove the hard requirement of university degrees</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>I retain the hope that someday this company can better their hiring processes and become a place to which I would recommend any of my developer friends.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/cfiloteo/dev/filoblog/src/pages/2017-06-07-why-I-wont-recommend-my-employer/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"timeToRead\":3,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"2017-06-07T00:00:00.000Z\",\"path\":\"/posts/why-im-not-currently-recommending-my-employer\",\"tags\":[\"employment\"],\"title\":\"Why I won't recommend my employer\"}}],\"angular\":[{\"excerpt\":\"I sometimes see developers ask \\\"Should I use React, or Angular, or Vue.js, or  [ insert new framework here ] ?\\\" and every time, I see fanatics immediately jump to recommending one without any real justification.

Now, I'm no expert but I do have experience with both Angular and React. This post lists some of the differences between the actual usage of Angular (2+) and React. I hope to just shed some light on the practical differences between them to help you understand the decision a bit better.</p>\\n<h3>Complexity</h3>\\n<p>Frameworks are abstractions to help reduce the complexity of building an application. Frameworks in turn introduce their own complexity. First, let's establish that each framework falls somewhere on a complexity spectrum.<a href=\\\"#vuejsTalk\\\">¹</a></p>\\n<p></p>\\n<p>This is the first problem: <strong>React and Angular are at different points of the complexity spectrum</strong>. They're solving problems in different ways, and will never be equal to each other in scope. Using another analogy, they're different tools for different and various jobs; some of those jobs overlap, others don't.</p>\\n<p>For the most part, choosing between them based on this alone is <strong>moot</strong>. Why? Because React is \\\"unopinionated\\\" so you bring your own solution to solve problem X. Inversely, Angular provides many tools together into one framework. It is not an apples-to-apples comparison.</p>\\n<h4>Complexity: React</h4>\\n<p>Let's start with React here. React is not a complete framework, you are required to bring in dependencies on your own. This is can be great but also daunting. Not all developers who work on the web know about the very latest libs, are proficient with <code>npm</code> or <code>yarn</code>, or can set up an ES6 project to transpile down to ES5.</p>\\n<p>In an enterprise setting, choosing a library might need more consideration than \\\"just because\\\". Does the lib's license allow enterprise use? What if an engineering manager needs to know the difference between various libs? Which library contains enough features to support future projects/requirements?</p>\\n<p>A personal experience of this I had is choosing an HTTP library. There are so many great choices! Some of the ones I've looked at to use with React are:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios\\\">Axios</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent\\\">Superagent</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird\\\">Bluebird</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/github/fetch\\\">Fetch</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/developit/unfetch\\\">Unfetch</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The company I work for is slowly coming around to adopting React but what's there to stop each team from choosing a different lib from of the above? Allowing this sort of fragmentation makes it that much harder to share code and contribute to other teams. Furthermore, making a decision to standardize one requires intimate knowledge of the features, benefits, and disadvantages of each.</p>\\n<p>Now, <em>this evaluation process isn't bad</em>! It would GREAT to make a thorough and informed decision but not every developer or team is equipped to make this kind of analysis for every dependency. If this isn't something that you or your team can or want to do, then consider a full framework like Angular. Conversely, if developers are passionate about jumping in and learning each lib quickly then this isn't a problem.</p>\\n<h4>Complexity: Angular</h4>\\n<p>With Angular you're getting many of libraries together from a single source, compatible and tested. Angular is an abstraction built on top of a component model, TypeScript, RxJS, Webpack, to name a few. The advantages I see here are:</p>\\n<ul>\\n    <li>Documentation exists showing how to use each lib within context of the framework</li>\\n    <li>Each standard lib will be compatible and integrates better than external libs might</li>\\n    <li>a solution is already \\\"chosen\\\" for you by the time you encounter a problem to be solved</li>\\n    <li>Angular's implementation of semver means that most updates will follow a compatible rhythm</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>There are some disadvantages:</p>\\n<ul>\\n    <li>You're getting a whole lot of framework to have to learn together, the learning curve here can be steep and overwhelming</li>\\n    <li>Angular's documentation is not the very best</li>\\n    <li>there's no sensibility in trying to replace one part of the framework for another lib</li>\\n    <li>Full-frameworks can add in a lot of code that you don't use<sup>*</sup></li>\\n    <li>Re-using the Angular namespace means that there's a lot of conflation between AngularJS (version 1) and Angular (2+)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><sup>*</sup>Both frameworks, if configured properly, discards unused dependencies from a production build (a process known as tree-shaking).</p>\\n<h3>Framework</h3>\\n<p>React's model of a single component drives to you really want to keep your components tiny, and import the rest. On average, my React components stay at less than 50 lines. Keeping components tiny really helps with composability.\\nAngular uses a similar component model, but requires at least 10+ lines just to declare, along 2 accompanying files—a template file and a style file. Keeping the template separate has had an unforeseen consequence: templates get <em>huge</em> and end up more bloated than needed. Because of this, I feel like there's a desire to add more logic to the class than a single component actually needs. Its all to easy to bloat a single component instead of breaking it out into smaller pieces.</p>\\n<h3>Tools</h3>\\n<p>React has <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app\\\">create-react-app</a>, a very small commandline tool to generate a React project. It's purposefully pretty bare bones and new features are only added with much consideration and discussion. In my subjective experience, I've found that a sizable number of people chose to eject so that they have more control over their build config.

React is the <strong>#1</strong> most-loved and 3rd most wanted framework<a href=\\\"#StackOverflowDeveloperSurvey2017\\\">²</a> according to StackOverflow's 2017 Developer Survey. There are tons of React-based projects (this blog uses <a href=\\\"https://phenomic.io/\\\">Phenomic</a>! 🤘 ) as well as React components. React's single-responsibility model has led to development of other great community-driven libraries that can enhance your app's functionality. Projects like <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router\\\">React Router</a>, <a href=\\\"http://redux.js.org/\\\">Redux</a>/<a href=\\\"https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx\\\">MobX</a>, and React Native have all sprouted and thrived under <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/869732167814848512\\\">the big React tent</a>.</p>\\n<p>Even more interesting, <a href=\\\"https://preactjs.com/\\\">Preact</a> and <a href=\\\"https://infernojs.org/\\\">Inferno</a> are <em>\\\"almost drop-in\\\"</em> alternatives that have same/similar API; I find that many developers using React have literally never heard of either 🤔 yet these can offer even better performance for many apps.</p>\\n<p>React's ecosystem is as prolyfic as one could hope for.</p>\\n<h4>Ecosystem: Angular</h4>\\n<p>Angular on the other hand feels very much like \\\"corporate\\\" or enterprise softare. The API very much feels like <em>This is how we solved this problem, and you get to use it that way</em>. Regardless, adoption of Angular 2 has not lagged behind at all.</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" data-lang=\\\"en\\\"><p lang=\\\"en\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">1.3 million people use Angular 1.<br>480k already use Angular 2.</p>&mdash; David East (@_davideast) <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/_davideast/status/776244105261133824\\\">September 15, 2016</a></blockquote>\\n<script defer src=\\\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\\\" charset=\\\"utf-8\\\"></script>\\n<p>And this quote is somewhat old; these numbers have most likely increased.

Aside from these projects there aren't as many thriving projects built for Angular as I'd like to see. Many of these have gotten out of date very fast.</p>\\n<p>TypeScript has seen some great progress and adoption in the JS community as a whole; its the 3rd most loved and 6th most wanted language of 2017<a href=\\\"#StackOverflowDeveloperSurvey2017\\\">²</a>! Furthermore, a success with TypeScript that I've experienced is that it makes backend developers a more comfortable writing JavaScript. It enables bringing in some concepts that can help make a webapp more robust, in addition to being an ES6 transpiler. Learning TypeScript's features and syntax was not difficult.</p>\\n<p>The most difficult part of using TypeScript is finding the correct type definitions (typings) to go along with your dependent libs. Most are available via npm under the <code>@types</code> namespace but if that isn't the case, you lose the main benefit of TypeScript in the first place: type safety. At the same time, that's no reason not to use Angular! It would make the developer all that better by taking the initiative to contribute the types. Yay for open source software! But this is a challege that you may face with Angular.</p>\\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\\n<p>This long-winded explanation is really just to say: Don't choose between React and Angular just because you're a fan of one. <strong>Choose the one that fits your project's requirements; the one whose risks and challenges you're willing to accept; the one that is the sane investment considering the needs of the developer, team, and business.</strong> Ultimately, both frameworks are backed by major companies. Both have great developers that lead them, and communities surrounding them. Both solve complex problems and can be used to build great web apps.</p>\\n<p>If you can, don't lock yourself into one. Always keep learning about what else can solve the problem at hand. ✌️</p>\\n<hr>\\n<small>\\nFootnotes:\\n<ul>\\n<li><a name=\\\"vuejsTalk\\\" href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBBSp_iIiVM\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">1: \\\"Vue.js: the Progressive Framework\\\"</a></li>\\n<li><a name=\\\"StackOverflowDeveloperSurvey2017\\\" href=\\\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">2: StackOverflow Developer Survey 2017</a></li>\\n<li><a name=\\\"footnote2\\\">3: </a> I don't think the survey properly distinguishes between AngularJS (version 1) and Angular (2+).

NgContent isn't well documented.</p>\\n<h3>Why isn't <code>ng-content</code> self-closing?</h3>\\n<p><code>ng-content</code> is to be used like any other element. This is great, especially for rendering in default content. For example, a component that can transclude some content but if for some reason nothing is nested into it, it will show a default state.</p>\\n<pre><code>&#x3C;profile-card>\\n    &#x3C;ng-content>\\n        &#x3C;img src=\\\"/defaultProfile.jpg\\\"/>\\n        &#x3C;p>Unknown&#x3C;/p>\\n    &#x3C;/ng-content>\\n&#x3C;/profile-card>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>But what if you don't need anything within the opening and closing tags? You'd think that just <code>&#x3C;ng-content /></code> would be a nice and simple way to signal where to place the included content, but attempting to do so generates the following error:</p>\\n<pre><code>Template parse errors: Only void and foreign elements can be self closed \\\"ng-content\\\"\\n[ERROR ->]&#x3C;ng-content />\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Seems weird to me. This may be by design.</p>\\n<h3>Select is only able to find immediate children?</h3>\\n<p>One of the features of <code>ng-content</code> is that you can use the <code>select</code> attribute on it to pull transcluded content into a specific location.</p>\\n<pre><code>&#x3C;!-- my-component.html -->\\n&#x3C;div>\\n    &#x3C;ng-content select=\\\".title\\\">&#x3C;/ng-content>\\n    &#x3C;ng-content select=\\\".subtitle\\\">&#x3C;/ng-content>\\n&#x3C;/div>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This is great for enforcing layout in a specific way. Except... it has a <strong>major</strong> caveat, at least in my opinion. This select only seems to match <em>immediate children only</em>, nothing else.</p>\\n<p>So using the above <code>my-component</code>, this belwo works while placing the <code>title</code> above the <code>subtitle</code>:</p>\\n<pre><code>&#x3C;my-component>\\n    &#x3C;p class=\\\"subtitle\\\">world&#x3C;/p>\\n    &#x3C;h2 class=\\\"title\\\">Hello&#x3C;/h2>\\n&#x3C;/my-component>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>but then this doesn't! Nothing is rendered.</p>\\n<pre><code>&#x3C;my-component>\\n    &#x3C;div>\\n        &#x3C;h2 class=\\\"title\\\">Hello&#x3C;/h2>\\n        &#x3C;p class=\\\"subtitle\\\">world&#x3C;/p>\\n    &#x3C;/div>\\n&#x3C;/my-component>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>It can't find these same elements  because they're wrapped in an extra div? I would have thought that it would match those elements as well, just like <code>querySelector</code> or CSS selectors would. If I only wanted immediate children I would have used something like <code>select=\\\"> .title\\\"</code>. My assumption that it used standard selectors is wrong? ¯\\\\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯ That sucks.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/cfiloteo/dev/filoblog/src/pages/2017-04-05-thoughts-on-angular-ng-content/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"timeToRead\":2,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"2017-04-05T00:00:00.000Z\",\"path\":\"/posts/thoughts-on-angular-ngcontent\",\"tags\":[\"angular\"],\"title\":\"Thoughts on Angular: Ng-Content\"}}],\"react\":[{\"excerpt\":\"I sometimes see developers ask \\\"Should I use React, or Angular, or Vue.js, or  [ insert new framework here ] ?\\\" and every time, I see fanatics immediately jump to recommending one without any real justification.

Now, I'm no expert but I do have experience with both Angular and React. This post lists some of the differences between the actual usage of Angular (2+) and React. I hope to just shed some light on the practical differences between them to help you understand the decision a bit better.</p>\\n<h3>Complexity</h3>\\n<p>Frameworks are abstractions to help reduce the complexity of building an application. Frameworks in turn introduce their own complexity. First, let's establish that each framework falls somewhere on a complexity spectrum.<a href=\\\"#vuejsTalk\\\">¹</a></p>\\n<p></p>\\n<p>This is the first problem: <strong>React and Angular are at different points of the complexity spectrum</strong>. They're solving problems in different ways, and will never be equal to each other in scope. Using another analogy, they're different tools for different and various jobs; some of those jobs overlap, others don't.</p>\\n<p>For the most part, choosing between them based on this alone is <strong>moot</strong>. Why? Because React is \\\"unopinionated\\\" so you bring your own solution to solve problem X. Inversely, Angular provides many tools together into one framework. It is not an apples-to-apples comparison.</p>\\n<h4>Complexity: React</h4>\\n<p>Let's start with React here. React is not a complete framework, you are required to bring in dependencies on your own. This is can be great but also daunting. Not all developers who work on the web know about the very latest libs, are proficient with <code>npm</code> or <code>yarn</code>, or can set up an ES6 project to transpile down to ES5.</p>\\n<p>In an enterprise setting, choosing a library might need more consideration than \\\"just because\\\". Does the lib's license allow enterprise use? What if an engineering manager needs to know the difference between various libs? Which library contains enough features to support future projects/requirements?</p>\\n<p>A personal experience of this I had is choosing an HTTP library. There are so many great choices! Some of the ones I've looked at to use with React are:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios\\\">Axios</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent\\\">Superagent</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird\\\">Bluebird</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/github/fetch\\\">Fetch</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/developit/unfetch\\\">Unfetch</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The company I work for is slowly coming around to adopting React but what's there to stop each team from choosing a different lib from of the above? Allowing this sort of fragmentation makes it that much harder to share code and contribute to other teams. Furthermore, making a decision to standardize one requires intimate knowledge of the features, benefits, and disadvantages of each.</p>\\n<p>Now, <em>this evaluation process isn't bad</em>! It would GREAT to make a thorough and informed decision but not every developer or team is equipped to make this kind of analysis for every dependency. If this isn't something that you or your team can or want to do, then consider a full framework like Angular. Conversely, if developers are passionate about jumping in and learning each lib quickly then this isn't a problem.</p>\\n<h4>Complexity: Angular</h4>\\n<p>With Angular you're getting many of libraries together from a single source, compatible and tested. Angular is an abstraction built on top of a component model, TypeScript, RxJS, Webpack, to name a few. The advantages I see here are:</p>\\n<ul>\\n    <li>Documentation exists showing how to use each lib within context of the framework</li>\\n    <li>Each standard lib will be compatible and integrates better than external libs might</li>\\n    <li>a solution is already \\\"chosen\\\" for you by the time you encounter a problem to be solved</li>\\n    <li>Angular's implementation of semver means that most updates will follow a compatible rhythm</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>There are some disadvantages:</p>\\n<ul>\\n    <li>You're getting a whole lot of framework to have to learn together, the learning curve here can be steep and overwhelming</li>\\n    <li>Angular's documentation is not the very best</li>\\n    <li>there's no sensibility in trying to replace one part of the framework for another lib</li>\\n    <li>Full-frameworks can add in a lot of code that you don't use<sup>*</sup></li>\\n    <li>Re-using the Angular namespace means that there's a lot of conflation between AngularJS (version 1) and Angular (2+)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><sup>*</sup>Both frameworks, if configured properly, discards unused dependencies from a production build (a process known as tree-shaking).</p>\\n<h3>Framework</h3>\\n<p>React's model of a single component drives to you really want to keep your components tiny, and import the rest. On average, my React components stay at less than 50 lines. Keeping components tiny really helps with composability.\\nAngular uses a similar component model, but requires at least 10+ lines just to declare, along 2 accompanying files—a template file and a style file. Keeping the template separate has had an unforeseen consequence: templates get <em>huge</em> and end up more bloated than needed. Because of this, I feel like there's a desire to add more logic to the class than a single component actually needs. Its all to easy to bloat a single component instead of breaking it out into smaller pieces.</p>\\n<h3>Tools</h3>\\n<p>React has <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app\\\">create-react-app</a>, a very small commandline tool to generate a React project. It's purposefully pretty bare bones and new features are only added with much consideration and discussion. In my subjective experience, I've found that a sizable number of people chose to eject so that they have more control over their build config. This usually happens when they seek to include a feature/build step that CRA can't/won't include.</p>\\n<p>Angular has the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli\\\">angular-cli</a>, a very functional commandline tool that pulls together a great number of useful features:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Generator (like Yeoman)</li>\\n<li>Dev server with live reload (using webpack-dev-server)</li>\\n<li>Preconfigured css preprocessing (Sass, Less, or Stylus)</li>\\n<li>Preconfigured linting (tslint)</li>\\n<li>Preconfigured testing (Karma)</li>\\n<li>Build configuration for dev &#x26; production</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The Angular CLI has become much more robust and helps many devs quickly achieve things that might take much more manual configuration and experience. I've very much enjoyed using the Angular CLI. The biggest issue I've had with it are bad configurations: retroactive upgrades, version mismatches, or borked upgrades.</p>\\n<h4>Ecosystem: React</h4>\\n<p>React, backed by Facebook, has been favored by many developers and companies, like Microsoft and Samsung.

Furthermore, a success with TypeScript that I've experienced is that it makes backend developers a more comfortable writing JavaScript. It enables bringing in some concepts that can help make a webapp more robust, in addition to being an ES6 transpiler. Learning TypeScript's features and syntax was not difficult.</p>\\n<p>The most difficult part of using TypeScript is finding the correct type definitions (typings) to go along with your dependent libs. Most are available via npm under the <code>@types</code> namespace but if that isn't the case, you lose the main benefit of TypeScript in the first place: type safety. At the same time, that's no reason not to use Angular! It would make the developer all that better by taking the initiative to contribute the types. Yay for open source software! But this is a challege that you may face with Angular.</p>\\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\\n<p>This long-winded explanation is really just to say: Don't choose between React and Angular just because you're a fan of one. <strong>Choose the one that fits your project's requirements; the one whose risks and challenges you're willing to accept; the one that is the sane investment considering the needs of the developer, team, and business.</strong> Ultimately, both frameworks are backed by major companies. Both have great developers that lead them, and communities surrounding them. Both solve complex problems and can be used to build great web apps.</p>\\n<p>If you can, don't lock yourself into one. Always keep learning about what else can solve the problem at hand. ✌️</p>\\n<hr>\\n<small>\\nFootnotes:\\n<ul>\\n<li><a name=\\\"vuejsTalk\\\" href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBBSp_iIiVM\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">1: \\\"Vue.js: the Progressive Framework\\\"</a></li>\\n<li><a name=\\\"StackOverflowDeveloperSurvey2017\\\" href=\\\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">2: StackOverflow Developer Survey 2017</a></li>\\n<li><a name=\\\"footnote2\\\">3: </a> I don't think the survey properly distinguishes between AngularJS (version 1) and Angular (2+).

The end result is <a href=\\\"https://github.com/filoxo/simple-style\\\">Simple Style</a> (which is still a WIP as requirements come up). Surprisingly, using <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/@dabit3/introduction-to-using-npm-as-a-build-tool-b41076f488b0#.5w4loc8uy\\\">npm as a build tool</a> made it extremely easy to set up a dev environment. I'll review everything about the setup in this post for my own documentation, but hopefully can also serve as a clean, straightforward example.</p>\\n<p>I used <a href=\\\"https://yarnpkg.com/en/\\\"><code>yarn</code></a> for this experiment instead of <code>npm</code> solely for the speed improvements. Fortunately, <code>yarn</code>'s commands all have their <code>npm</code> equivalents so don't get hung up on the differences.</p>\\n<p>This basic setup offers:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Autoprefixing to support the 2 latest browsers</li>\\n<li>Future CSS syntax usable today</li>\\n<li>minification</li>\\n<li>optimizations</li>\\n<li>a quick and easy development setup to reflect changes on-the-fly</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Dev dependencies</h3>\\n<p>Here are our initial development dependencies:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/\\\">normalize.css</a>: so that all elements render consistently</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/postcss/postcss\\\">PostCSS</a>'s CLI: to leverage its ecosystem of feature plugins</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://cssnext.io/\\\">CSSnext</a>: a PostCSS plugin that helps you to use the latest CSS syntax today. This way the code will be a little more future-proof. Additionally, CSSnext also includes <a href=\\\"https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer\\\">Autoprefixer</a> as a dependency.</li>\\n<li><code>postcss-import</code>: used to pull in a css file that wasn't being preprocessed</li>\\n<li><code>cssnano</code>: minify and optimize output</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Install using yarn (or the npm equivalent)</p>\\n<pre><code>yarn add -D normalize.css postcss-cli postcss-cssnext postcss-import cssnano\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>PostCSS config</h3>\\n<p>Create a json file that contains the config for PostCSS. The docs named it <strong>options.json</strong> but I choose <strong>postcss.json</strong> for better clarity. The comments below explain some keys.</p>\\n<pre><code>{\\n    // Enable plugins in order\\n    \\\"use\\\": [\\n        \\\"postcss-import\\\",\\n        \\\"postcss-cssnext\\\",\\n        \\\"cssnano\\\"\\n    ],\\n    \\\"input\\\": \\\"main.css\\\",\\n    \\\"output\\\": \\\"dist/main.css\\\",\\n    // use locally installed plugins (eg. in node_modules)\\n    \\\"local-plugins\\\": true,\\n    // Enable sourcemaps\\n    \\\"map\\\": true,\\n    // CSSnext and cssnano both use autoprefixer, but for different features/purposes\\n    // see https://github.com/MoOx/postcss-cssnext/issues/323\\n    \\\"postcss-cssnext\\\": {\\n        \\\"warnForDuplicates\\\": false\\n    }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>CSS time</h3>\\n<p>Go ahead and create <strong>main.css</strong> at the project root. The above config will output to <strong>dist/</strong>. Here's a quick sample to put into the file for now.</p>\\n<pre><code>@import('normalize.css');\\n\\n:root {\\n    --color-primary: blue;\\n    --color-secondary: red;\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Building</h3>\\n<p>Use the postcss-cli with the config file passed in as an arg and save it as an npm script.</p>\\n<pre><code>\\\"scripts\\\": {\\n    \\\"build\\\": \\\"node_modules/postcss-cli/bin/postcss -c postcss.json\\\"\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now you can simply run <code>yarn run build</code> and your css will be processed and output to <strong>dist</strong>. But we can still do better.</p>\\n<h3>Watch for changes</h3>\\n<p>Enabling watch will auto-transform the css file on changes. Add another npm script, which is exactly the same as <code>build</code> but with the watch flag.</p>\\n<pre><code>\\\"build:dev\\\": \\\"node_modules/postcss-cli/bin/postcss -c postcss.json -w\\\"\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Livereload</h3>\\n<p>You wouldn't develop a CSS framework without seeing it rendered on a page so let's create a test page for development. Create <strong>index.html</strong> at the project root and populate it with some HTML, and add a link to your <strong>main.css</strong> file.</p>\\n<pre><code>&#x3C;!doctype html>\\n&#x3C;html lang=\\\"en-US\\\">\\n    &#x3C;head>\\n        &#x3C;link rel=\\\"stylesheet\\\" href=\\\"/dist/main.css\\\">\\n    &#x3C;/head>\\n    &#x3C;body>\\n        &#x3C;main>Hello world&#x3C;/main>\\n    &#x3C;/body>\\n&#x3C;/html>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/lr-http-server\\\"><code>lr-http-server</code></a> will reload on changes, as well as a functioning http server.</p>\\n<pre><code>yarn add -D lr-http-server\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>And then register a new npm script for it</p>\\n<pre><code>\\\"reload\\\": \\\"lr-http-server -p 3000\\\"\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Composing scripts</h3>\\n<p>We want the two above scripts to run in parallel so that if either the css or the html file changes the livereload server will do its job. <a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all\\\"><code>npm-run-all</code></a> with the <code>-p</code> (parallel) flag does this exactly.</p>\\n<pre><code>yarn add -D npm-run-all\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Join the two tasks together into a single npm script</p>\\n<pre><code>\\\"start\\\": \\\"npm-run-all -p build:dev reload\\\"\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>And then run easily with</p>\\n<pre><code>yarn start\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Done!</h3>\\n<p>You're ready to keep going developing your styles inside <strong>main.css</strong>.

In this post I'll revisit my choice of tooling.</p>\\n<h3>Password manager</h3>\\n<p>Having put a password manager in place to store, generate, and access my passphrases has been one of the most beneficial tools I've been able to use in my day-to-day. KeePass has long been the standard for accomplishing this but the clients built around it have not kept up—at least not very well.</p>\\n<h4>KeeWeb</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://keeweb.info/\\\">KeeWeb</a> is built with Electron and gives the KeePass standard a decent interface on Windows, MacOS, Linux, and even as a <a href=\\\"https://app.keeweb.info/\\\">web app</a>. It can sync with Google Drive, generate new passwords, and uses the same keyboard shortcuts as KeePassX and then some.</p>\\n<p>The only problem with this app is maybe a bug: it's browser autofill feature seems to populate the browser URL bar with the site and password, rather than navigating to the site before pasting in the credentials. This means that my browser history could potentially have a password in plain text. Because this is such a huge no-no I never use this feature anymore.</p>\\n<h4>LastPass</h4>\\n<p>I've also recently started using LastPass to store my work credentials as a way of keeping business and personal life separate. So far, LastPass has the most refined UI for managing user credentials. The website is further enhanced by adding a Chrome extension (thus meaning it can be used on all of the desktop platforms) as well as native mobile apps. I can't speak for iOS but on Android this app is a God-send. It taps into Android's accessibility features to allow it to monitor for password input fields. It injects the matching credentials very quickly and easily.</p>\\n<p>The mobile app can use your device's fingerprint sensor to unlock your database. You can even store other things, like product licenses, ssh keys, and file attachements. Novemeber of 2016 LastPass also made it free to use its mobile client so its now easier to use it anyway.</p>\\n<p>If you aren't using a password manager, I would recommend starting right now with LastPass.</p>\\n<h3>Mobile interoperability</h3>\\n<p>Nothing has changed on this front for me personally. While I'm still in envy about the iOS ecosystem and it's native interoperability, PushBullet still does the job for me. I use Mac anc Linux computers as well as Android and iOS mobile devices regularly.</p>\\n<p>I did sign up for the T-Mobile DIGITS beta, but... that's a bit far from polished for my liking.</p>\\n<h3>Terminal</h3>\\n<p>I was unexpectedly pleased when I decided to try out <a href=\\\"https://github.com/zeit/hyper\\\">Hyper terminal</a>. Also built on Electron, this terminal wrapper has gained a lot of popularity which in turns means its plugin ecosystem is thriving. For example, you can enable mouse scrolling to get through long documents using <code>hyperterm-alternatescroll</code>; or make links clickable by holding down a key with <code>hyperlinks-iterm</code>. Because all of this is stored in a config file I pulled over my settings and preferences to my work computer with a simple copy/paste.</p>\\n<h3>IDE</h3>\\n<p>I have long since been a fan of the JetBrains suite of IDEs. They do a great job of pulling together many tools into one application. But I've found that for small side projects &#x26; demos it is very heavy and a little distracting. SublimeText and Atom are great simple solutions but VS Code has taken their place for me. VS Code provides a balance between simplicity and functionality, so its not overly simplistic right out of the box. Built in Git tools, console window, and debugger are <em>really</em> useful for getting hacking quickly. And of course, because its also an Electron app, its plugin ecosystem has whatever you might ask for. Here are the ones I use:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Angular 2 TypeScript snippets</li>\\n<li>Auto-open Markdown Preview</li>\\n<li>Debugger for Chrome</li>\\n<li>EditorConfig for VS Code</li>\\n<li>Git History</li>\\n<li>JavaScript (ES6) code snippets</li>\\n<li>JSX</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Fin</h2>\\n<p>My objective here is just to give another perspective and voice to tools you might not have thought to try.

The end result is <a href=\\\"https://github.com/filoxo/simple-style\\\">Simple Style</a> (which is still a WIP as requirements come up). Surprisingly, using <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/@dabit3/introduction-to-using-npm-as-a-build-tool-b41076f488b0#.5w4loc8uy\\\">npm as a build tool</a> made it extremely easy to set up a dev environment. I'll review everything about the setup in this post for my own documentation, but hopefully can also serve as a clean, straightforward example.</p>\\n<p>I used <a href=\\\"https://yarnpkg.com/en/\\\"><code>yarn</code></a> for this experiment instead of <code>npm</code> solely for the speed improvements. Fortunately, <code>yarn</code>'s commands all have their <code>npm</code> equivalents so don't get hung up on the differences.</p>\\n<p>This basic setup offers:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Autoprefixing to support the 2 latest browsers</li>\\n<li>Future CSS syntax usable today</li>\\n<li>minification</li>\\n<li>optimizations</li>\\n<li>a quick and easy development setup to reflect changes on-the-fly</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Dev dependencies</h3>\\n<p>Here are our initial development dependencies:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/\\\">normalize.css</a>: so that all elements render consistently</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/postcss/postcss\\\">PostCSS</a>'s CLI: to leverage its ecosystem of feature plugins</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://cssnext.io/\\\">CSSnext</a>: a PostCSS plugin that helps you to use the latest CSS syntax today. This way the code will be a little more future-proof. Additionally, CSSnext also includes <a href=\\\"https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer\\\">Autoprefixer</a> as a dependency.</li>\\n<li><code>postcss-import</code>: used to pull in a css file that wasn't being preprocessed</li>\\n<li><code>cssnano</code>: minify and optimize output</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Install using yarn (or the npm equivalent)</p>\\n<pre><code>yarn add -D normalize.css postcss-cli postcss-cssnext postcss-import cssnano\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>PostCSS config</h3>\\n<p>Create a json file that contains the config for PostCSS. The docs named it <strong>options.json</strong> but I choose <strong>postcss.json</strong> for better clarity. The comments below explain some keys.</p>\\n<pre><code>{\\n    // Enable plugins in order\\n    \\\"use\\\": [\\n        \\\"postcss-import\\\",\\n        \\\"postcss-cssnext\\\",\\n        \\\"cssnano\\\"\\n    ],\\n    \\\"input\\\": \\\"main.css\\\",\\n    \\\"output\\\": \\\"dist/main.css\\\",\\n    // use locally installed plugins (eg. in node_modules)\\n    \\\"local-plugins\\\": true,\\n    // Enable sourcemaps\\n    \\\"map\\\": true,\\n    // CSSnext and cssnano both use autoprefixer, but for different features/purposes\\n    // see https://github.com/MoOx/postcss-cssnext/issues/323\\n    \\\"postcss-cssnext\\\": {\\n        \\\"warnForDuplicates\\\": false\\n    }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>CSS time</h3>\\n<p>Go ahead and create <strong>main.css</strong> at the project root. The above config will output to <strong>dist/</strong>. Here's a quick sample to put into the file for now.</p>\\n<pre><code>@import('normalize.css');\\n\\n:root {\\n    --color-primary: blue;\\n    --color-secondary: red;\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Building</h3>\\n<p>Use the postcss-cli with the config file passed in as an arg and save it as an npm script.</p>\\n<pre><code>\\\"scripts\\\": {\\n    \\\"build\\\": \\\"node_modules/postcss-cli/bin/postcss -c postcss.json\\\"\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now you can simply run <code>yarn run build</code> and your css will be processed and output to <strong>dist</strong>. But we can still do better.</p>\\n<h3>Watch for changes</h3>\\n<p>Enabling watch will auto-transform the css file on changes. Add another npm script, which is exactly the same as <code>build</code> but with the watch flag.</p>\\n<pre><code>\\\"build:dev\\\": \\\"node_modules/postcss-cli/bin/postcss -c postcss.json -w\\\"\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Livereload</h3>\\n<p>You wouldn't develop a CSS framework without seeing it rendered on a page so let's create a test page for development. Create <strong>index.html</strong> at the project root and populate it with some HTML, and add a link to your <strong>main.css</strong> file.</p>\\n<pre><code>&#x3C;!doctype html>\\n&#x3C;html lang=\\\"en-US\\\">\\n    &#x3C;head>\\n        &#x3C;link rel=\\\"stylesheet\\\" href=\\\"/dist/main.css\\\">\\n    &#x3C;/head>\\n    &#x3C;body>\\n        &#x3C;main>Hello world&#x3C;/main>\\n    &#x3C;/body>\\n&#x3C;/html>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/lr-http-server\\\"><code>lr-http-server</code></a> will reload on changes, as well as a functioning http server.</p>\\n<pre><code>yarn add -D lr-http-server\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>And then register a new npm script for it</p>\\n<pre><code>\\\"reload\\\": \\\"lr-http-server -p 3000\\\"\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Composing scripts</h3>\\n<p>We want the two above scripts to run in parallel so that if either the css or the html file changes the livereload server will do its job. <a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all\\\"><code>npm-run-all</code></a> with the <code>-p</code> (parallel) flag does this exactly.</p>\\n<pre><code>yarn add -D npm-run-all\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Join the two tasks together into a single npm script</p>\\n<pre><code>\\\"start\\\": \\\"npm-run-all -p build:dev reload\\\"\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>And then run easily with</p>\\n<pre><code>yarn start\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Done!</h3>\\n<p>You're ready to keep going developing your styles inside <strong>main.css</strong>.

In this post I'll revisit my choice of tooling.</p>\\n<h3>Password manager</h3>\\n<p>Having put a password manager in place to store, generate, and access my passphrases has been one of the most beneficial tools I've been able to use in my day-to-day. KeePass has long been the standard for accomplishing this but the clients built around it have not kept up—at least not very well.</p>\\n<h4>KeeWeb</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://keeweb.info/\\\">KeeWeb</a> is built with Electron and gives the KeePass standard a decent interface on Windows, MacOS, Linux, and even as a <a href=\\\"https://app.keeweb.info/\\\">web app</a>. It can sync with Google Drive, generate new passwords, and uses the same keyboard shortcuts as KeePassX and then some.</p>\\n<p>The only problem with this app is maybe a bug: it's browser autofill feature seems to populate the browser URL bar with the site and password, rather than navigating to the site before pasting in the credentials. This means that my browser history could potentially have a password in plain text. Because this is such a huge no-no I never use this feature anymore.</p>\\n<h4>LastPass</h4>\\n<p>I've also recently started using LastPass to store my work credentials as a way of keeping business and personal life separate. So far, LastPass has the most refined UI for managing user credentials. The website is further enhanced by adding a Chrome extension (thus meaning it can be used on all of the desktop platforms) as well as native mobile apps. I can't speak for iOS but on Android this app is a God-send. It taps into Android's accessibility features to allow it to monitor for password input fields. It injects the matching credentials very quickly and easily.</p>\\n<p>The mobile app can use your device's fingerprint sensor to unlock your database. You can even store other things, like product licenses, ssh keys, and file attachements. Novemeber of 2016 LastPass also made it free to use its mobile client so its now easier to use it anyway.</p>\\n<p>If you aren't using a password manager, I would recommend starting right now with LastPass.</p>\\n<h3>Mobile interoperability</h3>\\n<p>Nothing has changed on this front for me personally. While I'm still in envy about the iOS ecosystem and it's native interoperability, PushBullet still does the job for me. I use Mac anc Linux computers as well as Android and iOS mobile devices regularly.</p>\\n<p>I did sign up for the T-Mobile DIGITS beta, but... that's a bit far from polished for my liking.</p>\\n<h3>Terminal</h3>\\n<p>I was unexpectedly pleased when I decided to try out <a href=\\\"https://github.com/zeit/hyper\\\">Hyper terminal</a>. Also built on Electron, this terminal wrapper has gained a lot of popularity which in turns means its plugin ecosystem is thriving. For example, you can enable mouse scrolling to get through long documents using <code>hyperterm-alternatescroll</code>; or make links clickable by holding down a key with <code>hyperlinks-iterm</code>. Because all of this is stored in a config file I pulled over my settings and preferences to my work computer with a simple copy/paste.</p>\\n<h3>IDE</h3>\\n<p>I have long since been a fan of the JetBrains suite of IDEs. They do a great job of pulling together many tools into one application. But I've found that for small side projects &#x26; demos it is very heavy and a little distracting. SublimeText and Atom are great simple solutions but VS Code has taken their place for me. VS Code provides a balance between simplicity and functionality, so its not overly simplistic right out of the box. Built in Git tools, console window, and debugger are <em>really</em> useful for getting hacking quickly. And of course, because its also an Electron app, its plugin ecosystem has whatever you might ask for. Here are the ones I use:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Angular 2 TypeScript snippets</li>\\n<li>Auto-open Markdown Preview</li>\\n<li>Debugger for Chrome</li>\\n<li>EditorConfig for VS Code</li>\\n<li>Git History</li>\\n<li>JavaScript (ES6) code snippets</li>\\n<li>JSX</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Fin</h2>\\n<p>My objective here is just to give another perspective and voice to tools you might not have thought to try. Have any questions?
