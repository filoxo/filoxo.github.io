My employer is an amazing place to work if you can get your foot in the door. This complaint is with the <strong>hiring process</strong> only. There are some major issues with the hiring process that have made me extremely frustrated, to the point where I want to gripe about it.</p><h3>Into the void</h3><p>I&#x27;ve had many people reach out to me about applying, and as a developer there isn&#x27;t much more that I can do apart from give some general advice to prep for an interview and generating a referral.</p><p>The problem that has me furious is that after one of these individual applies, there&#x27;s little to no follow up from company. Only 13% of my referrals ever even received a response. The rest have sat in our recruiting system(s) as &quot;inactive&quot; or &quot;pending recruiter response&quot;. What bothers me about this is that this is polite and timely responses can be automated! Fire off an &#x27;Application Received&#x27; email; send a &#x27;Thank you for applying&#x27; once the position is closed; Deliver a &#x27;Sorry about the lack of response&#x27; message if an application has sat for X weeks without any recruiter activity.</p><p>Because this is so easy with modern systems and common-place at other companies, I find it <strong>extremely rude and inconsiderate</strong> to prospective employees for this company. I&#x27;ve now begun letting people know that they may not hear back at all, ever.Â ðŸ‘Ž</p><h3>Got Privilege? âœ…</h3><p>Another seemingly arbitrary requirement is that applicants must have a college degree. Seriously. I recently heard some spew about &quot;attempting to attract only the best&quot; but this ignores the fact that this is a <em>very bad</em> policy for diversity &amp; inclusion. The number of minorities (specifically hispanic and black) who graduate from college is far lower than white/Europeans.\nI&#x27;m not trying to fight for affirmative action here, but this can lead to a form of candidate suppression: many qualified people are immediately excluded from the pool. There are so many individuals who are very smart and higher education wasn&#x27;t in the cards for them. Real world experience and a proven track record is equally valuable in my experience.</p><p>Anectodally, I heard that an offer was <strong>reneged</strong> because the applicant didn&#x27;t have a degree, regardless of their previous experience. WTFÂ ðŸ˜ž</p><h3>Woe, woe, woe</h3><p>I <em>think</em> the main reason for this is because we have too few recruiters for the number of applicants. Our HR team is ~10 people in a company of 1500+ employeesâ€”that&#x27;s less than 1%. As a developer, I don&#x27;t know how many applications are received per opening but the two that I&#x27;ve been a part of have received 200+. That&#x27;s a lot of work for such a small team! The above mentioned practices really aren&#x27;t helping anything either. Its a people problem and a process problem.</p><p>Even more frustrating with the issue here is that there&#x27;s nothing I can really do. Sure, I could talk to someone higher up. I&#x27;ve complained somewhat openly to my coworkers. But honestly, there&#x27;s probably no real change that I can make. At least, not as a developer.</p><h3>On the bright side...</h3><p>Like I said at the beginning of this post, this company is <strong>great</strong> to work for if there was any possibility of being able to get an interview. I&#x27;m optimistic that the problems above are fairly easy to fix with just a few changes:</p><ul><li>Setup automated communications</li><li>Find flaws in the application pipeline and solve</li><li>Hire more/better personnel</li><li>Remove the hard requirement of university degrees</li></ul><p>I retain the hope that someday this company can better their hiring processes and become a place to which I would recommend any of my developer friends.</p></div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why I won't recommend my employer","date":"Jun 07, 2017","tags":["employment"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2017-06-07-why-I-wont-recommend-my-employer/"}}
