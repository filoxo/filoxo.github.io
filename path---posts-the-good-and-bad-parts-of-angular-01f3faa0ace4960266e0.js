I've used Angular 2+ heavily for the last year at work, have recently rewriten and Angular 1 app in React, and have chosen to use Vue for my personal projects for now. These are some of my thoughts on what I found to be some good and bad parts of Angular.</p>\n<h3>The Good</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>As a full framework, you'll experience less decision fatigue and won't have lib fragmentation. (eg. team A uses Axios, team B uses Superagent)</li>\n<li>‚ÄéTypeScript makes JavaScript feel familiar to backend/full-stack devs.</li>\n<li>RxJs/‚ÄéObservables are so awesome! This reactive data flow also helps you keep your components UI-focused.</li>\n<li>‚ÄéThe Angular CLI is fantastic! Its so good, in fact, that it hardly makes sense to use anything else.</li>\n<li>‚ÄéPredictable and periodical framework updates set a great rhythm. Of course, this is personal preference. I've read some other peoples' struggles with having gotten too far behind... but that hasn't been something I've dealt with.</li>\n<li>The animations API is good when it works. React's TransitionGroup is the equivalent, but most React beginners don't know about it or how to find it to solve animations with components mounting/unmounting. The Angular animations work well for this same usage, but there have been quite a few bugs with it between versions. I had to revert to CSS animations. Hopefully they've been fixed and that has stablized.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Bad</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>With TypeScript it is easy to bloat your code &#x26; forget to push business logic down to the server.</li>\n<li>‚ÄéModules+routes are the only option for creating code split boundaries. So far, there hasn't been a community-built solution for code splitting elsewhere.</li>\n<li>Using Services to manage state is hard. It almost doesn't make sense to have Services and I'm about 90% sure this syntax was carried over for those who have a hard time migrating from Angular 1. Because of this there is little to no standardization on how services should work or be used. We ended up using Services to only hold Observables...</li>\n<li>‚ÄéGood luck trying to get any native js modules to work. Maybe that lib doesn't have types. Or requires a browser global. Or can't be statically analyzed by the TS compiler... The list goes on.</li>\n<li>Testing is just BAD. Testing requires 30+ lines of boilerplate, and requires a lot of ceremony. I have not written a test that actually works with Angular that hasn't felt extremely frail. From configuring the TestBed to updating selectors, testing is a huge burden compared to how easy it is with React and Vue.</li>\n<li>Angular errors are convoluted and imprecise. Welcome to debugging hell. üëø</li>\n<li>Having a wrapping host element is bad for styling. This is mainly because we have a legacy style framework. One such problem was with a widget that uses immediate child selectors, and the host element prevents this from working correctly. If you could get total buy-in to encapsulated styles, you shouldn't face this issue.</li>\n<li>RxJs takes effort and time to master, and the docs could use a lot of work. We've had to learn about Observables,BehaviorSujects, Subscriptions, and a plethora of operators with difficult names (switchMap, flatMap, zip, idk how many more).</li>\n<li>‚ÄéThere's no equivalent of React's stateless functional component and that is sad. Sometimes it would be much easier if a component didn't need state and accept only Inputs (props for you React users).</li>\n<li>The <code>&#x3C;router-outlet></code> prevents you from being able flow data down to Components. This is a HUGE issue and I hate it with a passion.</li>\n<li>Development Tooling with Angular is severely lacking. Augury was an attempt at dev tools for Angular but is a total failure. Unable to view your Angular component tree or intereact with your data stores makes for a poor DX.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I've written approximately twice as many \"bads\" as \"goods\" for this article, but that doesn't mean I hate Angular. It is definitely a viable option, and still has the backing of Google despite sopm misteps. I just hope these issues are something you might analyze before using, or can use your voice and vote to help improve Angular.</p>",frontmatter:{date:"November 30, 2017",path:"/posts/the-good-and-bad-parts-of-angular",tags:["angular"],title:"The üëç and üëé parts of Angular"}}},pathContext:{prev:!1,next:{excerpt:"I want to make it clear that these opinions are my own and reflect only my experience.

My employer is an amazing place to work if you can get your foot in the door. This complaint is with the <strong>hiring process</strong> only. There are some major issues with the hiring process that have made me extremely frustrated, to the point where I want to gripe about it.</p>\n<h3>Into the void</h3>\n<p>I\'ve had many people reach out to me about applying, and as a developer there isn\'t much more that I can do apart from give some general advice to prep for an interview and generating a referral.</p>\n<p>The problem that has me furious is that after one of these individual applies, there\'s little to no follow up from company. Only 13% of my referrals ever even received a response. The rest have sat in our recruiting system(s) as "inactive" or "pending recruiter response". What bothers me about this is that this is polite and timely responses can be automated! Fire off an \'Application Received\' email; send a \'Thank you for applying\' once the position is closed; Deliver a \'Sorry about the lack of response\' message if an application has sat for X weeks without any recruiter activity.</p>\n<p>Because this is so easy with modern systems and common-place at other companies, I find it <strong>extremely rude and inconsiderate</strong> to prospective employees for this company. I\'ve now begun letting people know that they may not hear back at all, ever.¬†üëé</p>\n<h3>Got Privilege? ‚úÖ</h3>\n<p>Another seemingly arbitrary requirement is that applicants must have a college degree. Seriously. I recently heard some spew about "attempting to attract only the best" but this ignores the fact that this is a <em>very bad</em> policy for diversity &#x26; inclusion. The number of minorities (specifically hispanic and black) who graduate from college is far lower than white/Europeans.\nI\'m not trying to fight for affirmative action here, but this can lead to a form of candidate suppression: many qualified people are immediately excluded from the pool. There are so many individuals who are very smart and higher education wasn\'t in the cards for them. Real world experience and a proven track record is equally valuable in my experience.</p>\n<p>Anectodally, I heard that an offer was <strong>reneged</strong> because the applicant didn\'t have a degree, regardless of their previous experience. WTF¬†üòû</p>\n<h3>Woe, woe, woe</h3>\n<p>I <em>think</em> the main reason for this is because we have too few recruiters for the number of applicants. Our HR team is ~10 people in a company of 1500+ employees‚Äîthat\'s less than 1%. As a developer, I don\'t know how many applications are received per opening but the two that I\'ve been a part of have received 200+. That\'s a lot of work for such a small team! The above mentioned practices really aren\'t helping anything either. Its a people problem and a process problem.</p>\n<p>Even more frustrating with the issue here is that there\'s nothing I can really do. Sure, I could talk to someone higher up. I\'ve complained somewhat openly to my coworkers. But honestly, there\'s probably no real change that I can make. At least, not as a developer.</p>\n<h3>On the bright side...</h3>\n<p>Like I said at the beginning of this post, this company is <strong>great</strong> to work for if there was any possibility of being able to get an interview. I\'m optimistic that the problems above are fairly easy to fix with just a few changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setup automated communications</li>\n<li>Find flaws in the application pipeline and solve</li>\n<li>Hire more/better personnel</li>\n<li>Remove the hard requirement of university degrees</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I retain the hope that someday this company can better their hiring processes and become a place to which I would recommend any of my developer friends.</p>',id:"/Users/cfiloteo/dev/blog/src/pages/2017-06-07-why-I-wont-recommend-my-employer/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:3,frontmatter:{date:"2017-06-07T00:00:00.000Z",path:"/posts/why-im-not-currently-recommending-my-employer",tags:["employment"],title:"Why I won't recommend my employer"}}}}}});
