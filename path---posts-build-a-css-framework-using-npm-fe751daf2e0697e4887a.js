The end result is <a href="https://github.com/filoxo/simple-style">Simple Style</a> (which is still a WIP as requirements come up). Surprisingly, using <a href="https://medium.com/@dabit3/introduction-to-using-npm-as-a-build-tool-b41076f488b0#.5w4loc8uy">npm as a build tool</a> made it extremely easy to set up a dev environment. I\'ll review everything about the setup in this post for my own documentation, but hopefully can also serve as a clean, straightforward example.</p>\n<p>I used <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/"><code>yarn</code></a> for this experiment instead of <code>npm</code> solely for the speed improvements. Fortunately, <code>yarn</code>\'s commands all have their <code>npm</code> equivalents so don\'t get hung up on the differences.</p>\n<p>This basic setup offers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Autoprefixing to support the 2 latest browsers</li>\n<li>Future CSS syntax usable today</li>\n<li>minification</li>\n<li>optimizations</li>\n<li>a quick and easy development setup to reflect changes on-the-fly</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dev dependencies</h3>\n<p>Here are our initial development dependencies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">normalize.css</a>: so that all elements render consistently</li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/postcss/postcss">PostCSS</a>\'s CLI: to leverage its ecosystem of feature plugins</li>\n<li><a href="http://cssnext.io/">CSSnext</a>: a PostCSS plugin that helps you to use the latest CSS syntax today. This way the code will be a little more future-proof. Additionally, CSSnext also includes <a href="https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer">Autoprefixer</a> as a dependency.</li>\n<li><code>postcss-import</code>: used to pull in a css file that wasn\'t being preprocessed</li>\n<li><code>cssnano</code>: minify and optimize output</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Install using yarn (or the npm equivalent)</p>\n<pre><code>yarn add -D normalize.css postcss-cli postcss-cssnext postcss-import cssnano\n</code></pre>\n<h3>PostCSS config</h3>\n<p>Create a json file that contains the config for PostCSS. The docs named it <strong>options.json</strong> but I choose <strong>postcss.json</strong> for better clarity. The comments below explain some keys.</p>\n<pre><code>{\n    // Enable plugins in order\n    "use": [\n        "postcss-import",\n        "postcss-cssnext",\n        "cssnano"\n    ],\n    "input": "main.css",\n    "output": "dist/main.css",\n    // use locally installed plugins (eg. in node_modules)\n    "local-plugins": true,\n    // Enable sourcemaps\n    "map": true,\n    // CSSnext and cssnano both use autoprefixer, but for different features/purposes\n    // see https://github.com/MoOx/postcss-cssnext/issues/323\n    "postcss-cssnext": {\n        "warnForDuplicates": false\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>CSS time</h3>\n<p>Go ahead and create <strong>main.css</strong> at the project root. The above config will output to <strong>dist/</strong>. Here\'s a quick sample to put into the file for now.</p>\n<pre><code>@import(\'normalize.css\');\n\n:root {\n    --color-primary: blue;\n    --color-secondary: red;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Building</h3>\n<p>Use the postcss-cli with the config file passed in as an arg and save it as an npm script.</p>\n<pre><code>"scripts": {\n    "build": "node_modules/postcss-cli/bin/postcss -c postcss.json"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now you can simply run <code>yarn run build</code> and your css will be processed and output to <strong>dist</strong>. But we can still do better.</p>\n<h3>Watch for changes</h3>\n<p>Enabling watch will auto-transform the css file on changes. Add another npm script, which is exactly the same as <code>build</code> but with the watch flag.</p>\n<pre><code>"build:dev": "node_modules/postcss-cli/bin/postcss -c postcss.json -w"\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Livereload</h3>\n<p>You wouldn\'t develop a CSS framework without seeing it rendered on a page so let\'s create a test page for development. Create <strong>index.html</strong> at the project root and populate it with some HTML, and add a link to your <strong>main.css</strong> file.</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;!doctype html>\n&#x3C;html lang="en-US">\n    &#x3C;head>\n        &#x3C;link rel="stylesheet" href="/dist/main.css">\n    &#x3C;/head>\n    &#x3C;body>\n        &#x3C;main>Hello world&#x3C;/main>\n    &#x3C;/body>\n&#x3C;/html>\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/lr-http-server"><code>lr-http-server</code></a> will reload on changes, as well as a functioning http server.</p>\n<pre><code>yarn add -D lr-http-server\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then register a new npm script for it</p>\n<pre><code>"reload": "lr-http-server -p 3000"\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Composing scripts</h3>\n<p>We want the two above scripts to run in parallel so that if either the css or the html file changes the livereload server will do its job. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all"><code>npm-run-all</code></a> with the <code>-p</code> (parallel) flag does this exactly.</p>\n<pre><code>yarn add -D npm-run-all\n</code></pre>\n<p>Join the two tasks together into a single npm script</p>\n<pre><code>"start": "npm-run-all -p build:dev reload"\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then run easily with</p>\n<pre><code>yarn start\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Done!</h3>\n<p>You\'re ready to keep going developing your styles inside <strong>main.css</strong>. Feel free to improve upon this as needed!</p>',frontmatter:{date:"February 14, 2017",path:"/posts/build-a-css-framework-using-npm/",tags:["javascript","npm"],title:"Building a CSS framework using npm"}}},pathContext:{prev:{excerpt:"I recently came across some interesting behavior with Angular's   that I wanted to jot down so I can search for some answers.

NgContent isn\'t well documented.</p>\n<h3>Why isn\'t <code>ng-content</code> self-closing?</h3>\n<p><code>ng-content</code> is to be used like any other element. This is great, especially for rendering in default content. For example, a component that can transclude some content but if for some reason nothing is nested into it, it will show a default state.</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;profile-card>\n    &#x3C;ng-content>\n        &#x3C;img src="/defaultProfile.jpg"/>\n        &#x3C;p>Unknown&#x3C;/p>\n    &#x3C;/ng-content>\n&#x3C;/profile-card>\n</code></pre>\n<p>But what if you don\'t need anything within the opening and closing tags? You\'d think that just <code>&#x3C;ng-content /></code> would be a nice and simple way to signal where to place the included content, but attempting to do so generates the following error:</p>\n<pre><code>Template parse errors: Only void and foreign elements can be self closed "ng-content"\n[ERROR ->]&#x3C;ng-content />\n</code></pre>\n<p>Seems weird to me. This may be by design.</p>\n<h3>Select is only able to find immediate children?</h3>\n<p>One of the features of <code>ng-content</code> is that you can use the <code>select</code> attribute on it to pull transcluded content into a specific location.</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;!-- my-component.html -->\n&#x3C;div>\n    &#x3C;ng-content select=".title">&#x3C;/ng-content>\n    &#x3C;ng-content select=".subtitle">&#x3C;/ng-content>\n&#x3C;/div>\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is great for enforcing layout in a specific way. Except... it has a <strong>major</strong> caveat, at least in my opinion. This select only seems to match <em>immediate children only</em>, nothing else.</p>\n<p>So using the above <code>my-component</code>, this belwo works while placing the <code>title</code> above the <code>subtitle</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;my-component>\n    &#x3C;p class="subtitle">world&#x3C;/p>\n    &#x3C;h2 class="title">Hello&#x3C;/h2>\n&#x3C;/my-component>\n</code></pre>\n<p>but then this doesn\'t! Nothing is rendered.</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;my-component>\n    &#x3C;div>\n        &#x3C;h2 class="title">Hello&#x3C;/h2>\n        &#x3C;p class="subtitle">world&#x3C;/p>\n    &#x3C;/div>\n&#x3C;/my-component>\n</code></pre>\n<p>It can\'t find these same elements  because they\'re wrapped in an extra div? I would have thought that it would match those elements as well, just like <code>querySelector</code> or CSS selectors would. If I only wanted immediate children I would have used something like <code>select="> .title"</code>. My assumption that it used standard selectors is wrong?

In this post I'll revisit my choice of tooling.</p>\n<h3>Password manager</h3>\n<p>Having put a password manager in place to store, generate, and access my passphrases has been one of the most beneficial tools I've been able to use in my day-to-day. KeePass has long been the standard for accomplishing this but the clients built around it have not kept upâ€”at least not very well.</p>\n<h4>KeeWeb</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://keeweb.info/\">KeeWeb</a> is built with Electron and gives the KeePass standard a decent interface on Windows, MacOS, Linux, and even as a <a href=\"https://app.keeweb.info/\">web app</a>. It can sync with Google Drive, generate new passwords, and uses the same keyboard shortcuts as KeePassX and then some.</p>\n<p>The only problem with this app is maybe a bug: it's browser autofill feature seems to populate the browser URL bar with the site and password, rather than navigating to the site before pasting in the credentials. This means that my browser history could potentially have a password in plain text. Because this is such a huge no-no I never use this feature anymore.</p>\n<h4>LastPass</h4>\n<p>I've also recently started using LastPass to store my work credentials as a way of keeping business and personal life separate. So far, LastPass has the most refined UI for managing user credentials. The website is further enhanced by adding a Chrome extension (thus meaning it can be used on all of the desktop platforms) as well as native mobile apps. I can't speak for iOS but on Android this app is a God-send. It taps into Android's accessibility features to allow it to monitor for password input fields. It injects the matching credentials very quickly and easily.</p>\n<p>The mobile app can use your device's fingerprint sensor to unlock your database. You can even store other things, like product licenses, ssh keys, and file attachements. Novemeber of 2016 LastPass also made it free to use its mobile client so its now easier to use it anyway.</p>\n<p>If you aren't using a password manager, I would recommend starting right now with LastPass.</p>\n<h3>Mobile interoperability</h3>\n<p>Nothing has changed on this front for me personally. While I'm still in envy about the iOS ecosystem and it's native interoperability, PushBullet still does the job for me. I use Mac anc Linux computers as well as Android and iOS mobile devices regularly.</p>\n<p>I did sign up for the T-Mobile DIGITS beta, but... that's a bit far from polished for my liking.</p>\n<h3>Terminal</h3>\n<p>I was unexpectedly pleased when I decided to try out <a href=\"https://github.com/zeit/hyper\">Hyper terminal</a>. Also built on Electron, this terminal wrapper has gained a lot of popularity which in turns means its plugin ecosystem is thriving. For example, you can enable mouse scrolling to get through long documents using <code>hyperterm-alternatescroll</code>; or make links clickable by holding down a key with <code>hyperlinks-iterm</code>. Because all of this is stored in a config file I pulled over my settings and preferences to my work computer with a simple copy/paste.</p>\n<h3>IDE</h3>\n<p>I have long since been a fan of the JetBrains suite of IDEs. They do a great job of pulling together many tools into one application. But I've found that for small side projects &#x26; demos it is very heavy and a little distracting. SublimeText and Atom are great simple solutions but VS Code has taken their place for me. VS Code provides a balance between simplicity and functionality, so its not overly simplistic right out of the box. Built in Git tools, console window, and debugger are <em>really</em> useful for getting hacking quickly. And of course, because its also an Electron app, its plugin ecosystem has whatever you might ask for. Here are the ones I use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Angular 2 TypeScript snippets</li>\n<li>Auto-open Markdown Preview</li>\n<li>Debugger for Chrome</li>\n<li>EditorConfig for VS Code</li>\n<li>Git History</li>\n<li>JavaScript (ES6) code snippets</li>\n<li>JSX</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fin</h2>\n<p>My objective here is just to give another perspective and voice to tools you might not have thought to try. Have any questions? Feel free to reach out.</p>",id:"/Users/cfiloteo/dev/filoblog/src/pages/2017-02-05-crossplatform-revisited/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:3,frontmatter:{date:"2017-02-05T00:00:00.000Z",path:"/posts/crossplatform-revisited/",tags:["programming","javascript"],title:"Cross-platform Revisited"}}}}}});
